🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-08-04]**  
From language self-reflection tools to ensemble weight tuning — today's work was sharp, structured, and a step closer to submission excellence.

## 💡 Project Idea — *Echo Mirror: AI Language Habit Reflector*

Proposed an NLP-based tool that detects **repetitive linguistic habits** and gives feedback for improvement — inspired by self-awareness in communication.  

Concept:
- Input: user text (e.g. emails, messages, transcripts)
- Analysis: frequent phrases, filler words, sentiment tone
- Output: heatmap-style feedback and suggestions for clarity

## 🧪 Competition — *Electricity Usage Forecasting* (DACON)

### 24. Optuna-Tuned Voting Weights for Grouped Models

Kept the **Time × Building Type segmented VotingRegressor** structure,  
but used **Optuna** to optimize the weights *(XGB, LGBM, GBR)* for each of the 24 subgroups.

📊 **Results**  
- Local SMAPE: **11.7013**  
- Public LB: **9.46491** ✅ *New best*

---

### 25. Outlier Correction with IQR Filtering

Applied **IQR-based outlier correction** to VotingRegressor outputs for each group.  
Helps reduce extreme prediction noise and increase overall stability.

📊 **Results**  
- Local SMAPE: *(Pending)*  
- Public LB: *(Pending)*  
> *Currently running...*

## 📖 Paper Review — *DoWhy: A Library for Causal Inference*

Continued my review of the **DoWhy** framework, focusing on how it reframes causal inference as a transparent, testable process.  
Rather than treating causality as just another statistical problem, DoWhy emphasizes that  
> “Your assumptions are your model.”

Key insights from today:
- Causal analysis is structured into four clear steps: **Model → Identify → Estimate → Refute**
- Explicit assumptions (e.g., ignorability) are **not optional** — they must be declared and tested
- Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) help formalize **what we believe**, not just what we see
- Unlike traditional ML, DoWhy asks not *“What predicts Y?”* but *“Did X cause Y?”*

This mindset shift—from correlation to causation—feels essential for real-world decision-making tasks.

## 📝 TOEIC Study

D-27 until the test. Staying focused with intensive practice on both **Listening** and **Reading** sections.  
Currently working on an **error log** by part and identifying weak areas for targeted review.

---

## 🎧 Personal Project — *Bass Seeker*

Refined the direction for the **Bass Seeker** project.  
Created a new module `bass_selector` to filter songs based on low-end characteristics.  
First time working with **`ffmpeg`** and **`yt-dlp`**, which was tricky but rewarding.
