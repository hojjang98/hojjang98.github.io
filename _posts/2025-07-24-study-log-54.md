🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-07-23]**  
A day packed with project ideation, competition modeling, paper study, implementation, and GitHub cleanup.  
Gradually converging toward more structured motion evaluation experiments.

## 💡 Project Idea — *DanceMap: Mapping Genre-Based Dancer Hotspots in Seoul*

Outlined a project concept to visualize where dancers gather by genre (e.g., hip-hop, waacking, popping) using online behavioral signals.  
This idea connects my interest in pose estimation and urban culture data.

### Key Points:
- Aggregate social signals (hashtags, blogs, vlogs) to map genre-specific dance hubs  
- Help newcomers discover local dance scenes  
- Leverage NLP, geocoding, and spatiotemporal clustering  
- Visualize hotspots via Folium or Kakao Maps  
- Focus on **cultural equity** and **community visibility**

## 🗃 SQL Study

Reviewed subqueries with focus on:
- `SELECT`-based nested queries  
- `WHERE` conditions using `IN` and `EXISTS`  
- Correlated vs. non-correlated subqueries  
- Applied to practice examples for filtering and aggregation

## 🏆 Competition — *Electricity Usage Forecasting* (DACON)

Logged three new submissions focused on fast Optuna tuning + feature engineering:

| No. | Strategy                                       | Notes                                                       | SMAPE         |
|-----|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| 10  | Ensemble + 4 new features + Optuna (n=15)      | `hour_sin`, `cooling × hour`, etc. → improved performance   | **11.34327**  |
| 11  | XGBoost only + 4 features + Optuna (n=10)      | Efficient single-model tuning                              | 11.68912      |
| 12  | XGBoost + 5 more engineered features           | Slight overfitting observed despite additional features     | 13.66468      |

**Next Steps**:
- Try `StackingRegressor`  
- Segment models by building type (e.g., hospitals vs. offices)  
- Experiment with lag features and rolling statistics

## 📄 Paper Review — *Explainable Skeletal Evaluation for Martial Arts*

Read:  
**“Explainable Quality Assessment of Effective Aligned Skeletal Representations for Martial Arts Movements” (Scientific Reports, 2025)**

### Highlights:
- Combines Procrustes + DTW for spatial-temporal alignment  
- Uses Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, LSTM for motion scoring  
- Applies SHAP for explainable output per joint or body part  
- Strong candidate framework for practical feedback systems in sports/dance/rehab

## 🕺 CV Project — *PoseSyncEvaluator: 2D Dance Alignment with Pose & DTW*

Started implementing a pose-based movement evaluation system inspired by HDVR (ICCV 2021).  
Goal: evaluate dance similarity using 2D pose sequences only.

### Key Features:
- Pose extraction: MediaPipe (33 keypoints)  
- Similarity metrics: cosine similarity + FastDTW  
- Visualizations: similarity curve, DTW path  
- Stored in `01_pose-sync-evaluator.ipynb` (Colab)

This is the first step toward a larger `cv-projects` pipeline for real-time pose-based feedback.

- Shared 국민체조-based pose estimation experiment  
- Discussed possible generalization to healthcare applications  
- Compared related papers on skeleton alignment and scoring  
- Refactored repo structure, `.gitignore`, and notebooks for clarity
