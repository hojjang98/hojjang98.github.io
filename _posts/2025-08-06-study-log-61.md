🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-08-06]**  
Still feeling a bit tired, but managed to make focused progress on two major fronts — signal processing for music analysis and literature review for research novelty.

## 🎧 Project — *Bass Analyzer Module*

Created and refined the `bass_analyzer.ipynb` script.  
This notebook is part of the **Bass Seeker** project and focuses on analyzing low-frequency energy in `.wav` files.  

Key features:
- Extracts STFT from raw audio  
- Computes energy in defined low-frequency bands  
- Supports waveform and spectrum visualization  
- Prepares data for comparison across songs  

🛠 This is a core component that feeds into the upcoming bass recommendation pipeline.

## 📖 Paper Study — *Taekwondo Motion Evaluation Research*

Continued reading papers to strengthen our understanding of existing work in **pose-based action assessment**, particularly in Taekwondo.  
Main goal: identify **clear novelty** in our approach compared to existing literature.

Today's effort:
- Reviewed structural gaps in prior work (e.g., limited explainability, no RLHF, expert dependence)  
- Outlined how our RLHF-based evaluation system fills those gaps  
- Prepares the foundation for defining contribution scope and limitations

## ✅ TL;DR

📍 **Bass Analyzer**: Built and tested a notebook for low-frequency signal analysis in music (`bass_analyzer.ipynb`)  
📍 **Paper Review**: Studied pose-based Taekwondo evaluation systems to identify novelty in our RLHF-based approach
