🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-07-11]**  
Felt more energized today and wrapped up a key milestone!  
Closed the SCU_Competition project, dove into CV Chapter 3, studied EfficientNet Day 3, reviewed AI research tools, and organized initial research notes on Kakao’s platform dynamics.

## 📊 SCU_Competition — Final Submission Wrap-Up

**Focus**:  
- Completed final round of tuning and documentation  
- Reviewed feature importance and ensemble structure one last time  
- Archived experiment logs and updated leaderboard results

**Result**:  
- ✅ Best submission remains strong (AUC 0.9002)  
- ✅ Project officially **closed** — ready for final summary post

**Reflection**:  
- Learned the power of feature engineering + ensemble  
- Reproducibility and logging helped a lot during iteration

## 🧠 CV Study — Chapter 3 Summary

**Topics Covered**:  
- Implemented **MLP vs. CNN** from scratch  
- Understood how CNN learns spatial hierarchies  
- Compared performance and parameter count

**Reflection**:  
- CNN outperformed MLP significantly  
- This chapter gave great hands-on intuition before jumping into more complex models

## 📘 Paper Study — EfficientNet (Day 3)

**Focus**:  
- Studied **EfficientNet-B0 architecture** in depth  
- Reviewed how the model was designed via **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**  
- Understood the use of **compound scaling coefficients (ϕ, α, β, γ)** in building B1–B7 variants

**Reflection**:  
- NAS-generated B0 architecture is surprisingly elegant  
- Scaling strategy is both principled and effective  
- Looking forward to examining performance benchmarks and ablation results next

## 🧪 AI Research Tools — FastCampus Course

**Focus**:  
- Followed lessons on using **generative AI tools** to assist academic writing  
- Explored prompt engineering for summarization, paraphrasing, and citation organization

**Reflection**:  
- Tools can speed up **literature review** and draft generation  
- Planning to apply this for my **upcoming research paper**

---

## 🧠 Research Journal — Kakao Platform Study

**Topics Organized**:  
- Summarized key ideas around **platform economy** and **user lock-in**  
- Explored Kakao's influence on **digital accessibility**, **market fairness**, and **user behavior patterns**

**Reflection**:  
- If well-developed, this could be a **formal research topic**  
- Might pursue funding or academic support if aligned with program goals

## ❌ Skipped: SQL Study

Didn’t get around to SQL today — not a priority, but will return to it soon when needed for research or modeling.

---

## ✅ TL;DR

📍 **SCU**: Finalized and wrapped up competition work — ready to move on  
📍 **CV**: Studied Chapter 3 — MLP vs. CNN complete  
📍 **Paper**: EfficientNet Day 3 — B0 architecture & scaling logic deep dive  
📍 **AI Tools**: FastCampus course on academic writing with AI — good prep  
📍 **Research**: Outlined Kakao platform study — may develop into funded project  
📍 **Tomorrow**: Write, scale, and study — a well-rounded day ahead
