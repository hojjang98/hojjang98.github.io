🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-09-08]**  
Explored a new AR-based lifestyle idea, studied fundamentals of deep learning and blockchain, coordinated tasks for the paper study group, and deepened my understanding of the Transformer paper.

## 💡 Idea Generation  
- Proposed **AR Home Stylist**: an idea for using **AR to visualize interior design at home**.  
- Extended concept to connect not only with major companies’ products but also with **small businesses**, highlighting creativity and inclusivity.

## 📚 Classes  
- **Deep Learning**: Learned about **gradient descent, loss functions, and basic neural network structures**, with hands-on practice.  
- **Blockchain**: Studied the **hash function, block headers, and other core components** of blockchain technology.  

---

## 👥 Paper Study Group  
- Shared updates and coordinated tasks with teammates.  
- Decided to **take charge of skeleton analysis**, starting code implementation tomorrow.  

---

## 📖 Paper Review  
- Continued studying **“Attention Is All You Need.”**  
- Focused more deeply on **attention mechanisms** and mathematical formulations.  
- Challenging but rewarding step toward better understanding Transformers.
