🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-09-29]**  
Studied regression pipelines, blockchain consensus, and cryptography basics. Explored a new idea inspired by claw machines. Continued the **Vision Transformer** paper (Day 3) with focus on experiments and scaling.

## 📄 Coursework  
- **Big Data Analysis & AI Modeling**  
  - Learned the **full pipeline of linear regression**: preprocessing → modeling → evaluation (e.g., MAE).  

- **Blockchain & Cryptocurrency**  
  - Studied **public vs private blockchains**.  
  - Learned about **Proof-of-Stake** consensus (EOS as an example), contrasting it with Proof-of-Work.  

- **Understanding Cryptography**  
  - Took a short **quiz on classical ciphers**.  
  - Enjoyed applying manual calculations to encryption problems.

## 💡 Idea  
- Proposed **[Claw Machine Authentic Prize Verifier](https://github.com/hojjang98/ideas/blob/main/computer-vision/claw_check_authentic_prize_verifier.md)**.  
- Motivation: Questioned whether claw machine prizes are authentic → idea to verify authenticity **before attempting to grab**.

## 📖 Paper Study – Vision Transformer (ViT)  
- **Day 3 – Experiments & Scaling (Summary)**  
  - ViT **needs large-scale pretraining** (e.g., JFT-300M) to surpass CNNs.  
  - Outperforms **ResNets** on large datasets, but CNNs remain stronger on small datasets.  
  - Scaling laws confirmed: larger models + more data → better performance.  
  - Ablation studies show **patch size, depth, width, and regularization** critically influence results.  
  - **Limitation**: Requires huge compute and datasets, less accessible than CNNs.

## ✅ TL;DR  
📍 Learned regression pipelines and evaluation metrics  
📍 Compared PoW vs PoS blockchains (EOS as example)  
📍 Took a fun quiz on classical cryptography  
📍 New idea: claw machine prize authenticity checker  
📍 ViT (Day 3): Scaling laws proven, ViT strong with large data but costly
