🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-08-05]**  
Took it a bit slower today due to low energy, but still made progress on idea generation, SQL fundamentals, competition experiments, and continued the causal inference paper review.

## 💡 Project Idea — *AI Fatigue Journal*

Proposed a self-insight tool that estimates **mental fatigue levels** based on free-form text like journals or notes.  
Goes beyond simple writing — it analyzes patterns to detect signs of fatigue and visualizes trends over time.

Concept:
- Input: daily journals, memos, or messages
- Analysis: fatigue-related keywords, emotional tone, repetitive expressions
- Output: fatigue score, trend visualization, language habit feedback

## 🧪 Competition — *Electricity Usage Forecasting* (DACON)

Continued with enhancements to the segmented VotingRegressor architecture:

### 25. Outlier Correction using IQR  
- Applied IQR filtering on VotingRegressor predictions to reduce extreme noise  
📊  
- Local SMAPE: **11.6907**  
- Public LB: **15.1169**

### 26. Added Nonlinear Interaction Features  
- Kept the Time × Building Type segmented model  
- Added new features like Season × BuildingType, Temperature × Area, Humidity × CoolingArea  
📊  
- Local SMAPE: *(Pending)*  
- Public LB: **15.0829**

### 27. Feature Selection with Top 20 Important Features  
- Selected top 20 features based on importance  
- Aimed to reduce model complexity and improve generalization  
📊  
- Local SMAPE: *(Pending)*  
- Public LB: *(Pending)*

## 🧮 SQL Study — DDL (Data Definition Language)

Studied the **DDL** part of SQL today.  
Key focus:  
- `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `TRUNCATE`  
- DDL statements define and modify schema  
- Usually auto-committed → irreversible if done wrong

## 📖 Paper Review — *DoWhy: A Library for Causal Inference*

Continued reviewing the DoWhy framework.  
Today’s focus was on the importance of explicitly declaring assumptions and formalizing causal beliefs through DAGs.

Key takeaways:
- **“Assumptions are the model.”**  
- Causal inference is about **interventions and explanation**, not just prediction  
- The 4-step approach (Model → Identify → Estimate → Refute) provides a rigorous workflow
