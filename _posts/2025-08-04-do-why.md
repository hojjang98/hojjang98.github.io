## ✅ Day 1 – Causality over Correlation: Why DoWhy Matters

Today I studied the philosophical and structural foundations of the **DoWhy framework**,  
a causal inference library that bridges assumptions and statistical estimation into an explainable pipeline.

## 📌 Why This Paper?

While most machine learning models focus on prediction, few ask the deeper question:  
> “Did X actually cause Y?”

**DoWhy** offers a principled, testable framework that enables data scientists to move beyond surface-level associations and think structurally about cause-effect relationships.  
Its approach aligns perfectly with real-world problems like treatment effect estimation, behavioral analysis, and policy evaluation — where assumptions and interpretability matter just as much as numbers.

## 🧠 What I Learned – Modeling Causality, Not Just Fitting Curves

### 🔧 Motivation

- Most data analyses rely on **correlations** without questioning causality  
- Traditional ML methods lack **explicit, testable assumptions**  
- DoWhy fills this gap by turning causal reasoning into a structured, programmable process

### 🧭 The DoWhy Framework: A 4-Stage Causal Pipeline

| Step | Purpose | Guiding Question |
|------|---------|------------------|
| **1. Modeling** | Define causal assumptions using a graph | What do we assume about cause-effect structure? |
| **2. Identification** | Check if the causal effect is identifiable | Can this effect be computed from data and graph? |
| **3. Estimation** | Compute the effect using a statistical method | What’s the estimated effect size? |
| **4. Refutation** | Test robustness of the estimate | Could this result be biased or random? |

> 🧩 DoWhy treats causal inference as **a modular, explainable system** — not a single estimation step.

### 🔬 Key Concepts: Confounders and Backdoor Criterion

- A **confounder** is a variable that influences both treatment and outcome  
- The **backdoor criterion** determines whether controlling for certain variables allows for unbiased effect estimation  
- By conditioning on confounders, we can **block spurious paths** and isolate true causal effects

### 🧠 Example: Does Smoking Cause Lung Cancer?

A causal graph:

```bash

age → smoking → lung cancer
        ↑            ↑
    exercise       ??

```

- **Model**: Age and exercise are confounders  
- **Identify**: Backdoor adjustment possible through them  
- **Estimate**: Apply linear regression or matching  
- **Refute**: Swap treatment with placebo to test validity

## 📝 Takeaways

- Causal inference is not just a statistical task — it's a **logical structure of assumptions**  
- DoWhy encourages explicit reasoning, transparency, and testability  
- Even existing ML estimators (like regression or propensity scores) become **interpretable** within this pipeline  
- This framework transforms analysis from “prediction-only” to “understand-why”
