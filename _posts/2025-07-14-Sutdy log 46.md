🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-07-14]**  
Another productive day — wrapped up key topics across SQL, CV, paper study, and Kaggle exploration.  
Found a new competition to challenge myself with and improved CNN results on CIFAR-10!

---

## 🧪 SQL Study — DML / DCL / TCL

**Focus**:  
- Studied **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**, **Data Control Language (DCL)**, and **Transaction Control Language (TCL)**  
- Reviewed key commands like `INSERT`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `GRANT`, and more

**Reflection**:  
- Clearer understanding of database workflows  
- Useful for managing structured data in data pipelines and analytics tasks

## 🏁 Kaggle — New Competition Exploration

**Focus**:  
- Found a promising new competition: [2nd WEAR Dataset Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/2nd-wear-dataset-challenge/leaderboard)  
- Focused on **wearable sensor data** and **human activity recognition**

**Reflection**:  
- Great opportunity to explore **time-series + sensor modeling**  
- Planning to set up a baseline this week and iterate with feature extraction and LSTM/Transformer models

## 🧠 CV Study — Chapter 4: CIFAR-10 Classification

**Topics Covered**:  
- Followed the CNN-based implementation for CIFAR-10  
- Improved upon the book’s base model with **additional techniques**:
  - Data augmentation  
  - Dropout, BatchNorm  
  - L2 Regularization  
  - Tuned learning rate (Adam with 1e-4)

**Result**:  
- **Final Test Accuracy**: ~**67.2%** (book baseline was lower)  
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~66.7%

**Reflection**:  
- Strong improvement from baseline → real gain from regularization and augmentation  
- Ready to try more complex architectures next (e.g., ResNet)

## 📘 Paper Study — EfficientNet (Day 4)

**Focus**:  
- Continued reviewing Section 4.3 — **Scaling Results & Table 2**  
- Began interpreting performance improvements across EfficientNet-B1 to B7  
- Reviewed key **ablation study findings** and **model comparisons**

**Reflection**:  
- The compound scaling strategy scales better than naive methods  
- Planning to **wrap up study within 2 days**, then post final summary

---

## ✅ TL;DR

📍 **SQL**: Studied DML/DCL/TCL — important for DB & ETL workflows  
📍 **Kaggle**: Found new HAR competition — preparing first baseline  
📍 **CV**: Finished CIFAR-10 (Ch.4) — achieved ~67.2% test accuracy  
📍 **Paper**: EfficientNet Day 4 — analyzing scaling results & wrap-up soon  
📍 **Tomorrow**: Competition baseline, Paper Day 5, maybe some huggingface fun?
