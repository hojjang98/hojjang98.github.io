🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-07-21]**  
Today’s session covered a mix of test prep, ideation, team coordination, and project progress.  
Bit by bit, things are coming together — especially on the competition and GIS fronts.

## 📝 TOEIC Practice

Spent some focused time on TOEIC preparation.  
Mainly reviewed listening and grammar sections — just keeping the rhythm going.

## 💡 Idea Log — *Anti-Algorithm Concepts*

Brainstormed around the idea of **anti-algorithmic design**:  
Can we create systems that deliberately resist over-optimization or algorithmic exploitation?

- Inspired by platforms where recommendation engines or filters shape user reality  
- Considered how design could restore **organic exploration** or **human-centric randomness**  
- Might evolve into a blog or academic proposal later

## 📊 New Competition: *Electricity Usage Prediction* ([DACON Link](https://dacon.io/competitions/official/236531/overview/description))

Started a new competition on DACON — forecasting hourly electricity usage.  
It looks like a clean and well-scoped problem with rich time-series and weather data.

**Next Steps**:  
- Understand column roles  
- Clean missing values  
- Explore basic seasonal patterns  
- Establish baseline with LGBM or Prophet

## 📄 Paper Review — *Unsupervised 3D Pose Estimation for Hierarchical Dance Video Recognition*

**PDF**: [chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09166](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09166)  

Continued deep-diving into the paper.  
Today’s focus was understanding the **pose estimation pipeline** and reviewing previous sections.  
The occlusion handling and hierarchical structure still impress me in their simplicity and practicality.

## 🗺 Project Update — *Seoul Smoking Zone Mapping (GIS)*

Finished the **Yongsan-gu + Yeongdeungpo-gu** GIS project!  
All coordinate conversion, mapping, and proximity analysis are done.  
Even added marker styling, tooltips, and outlier filtering for cleaner visuals.

**Next Step**: Wrap it as a standalone repo with clean README and demo GIFs.

## 👥 Study Group — Team Lead Check-in

As the team lead for our current paper study, I shared the next focus areas and responsibilities for the upcoming sessions.  
Tried to keep the communication light but organized.

## ✅ TL;DR

📍 **TOEIC**: Kept up with grammar/listening practice  
📍 **Idea**: Brainstormed “anti-algorithmic” systems for more human-centered design  
📍 **Competition**: Started DACON electricity usage forecasting  
📍 **Paper**: Continued analysis of hierarchical pose estimation pipeline  
📍 **GIS**: Finished two-district smoking zone mapping project  
📍 **Study Group**: Shared direction and structure as team lead

💡 **Note**: I may start reworking this blog layout to focus more on each **project portfolio** as a showcase, not just daily tracking. Stay tuned.
