## ðŸ§  Day 1 Review â€” Abstract & Introduction

### âœ… Step 1: Abstract

- The paper proposes a novel pipeline called **HDVR (Hierarchical Dance Video Recognition)**.
- It performs **unsupervised 3D pose estimation** from 2D keypoints, requiring no 3D ground truth.
- An LSTM learns to classify dance genres from extracted 3D pose sequences, modeling 154 movement types from 16 body parts.

---

### âœ… Step 2: Motivation & Problem Definition

- Existing dance classification methods depend heavily on **appearance features** or **manual annotations**.
- 2D pose estimation alone suffers from **ambiguity** (e.g., depth, facing direction).
- This paper aims to recognize dance genres using only **2D pose input**, lifted into 3D space and analyzed temporally.

---

### âœ… Step 3: Proposed Hierarchical Framework

- The recognition process is broken into three levels:
  - **Low-level**: 2D pose estimation from raw video
  - **Mid-level**: Unsupervised 3D lifting + motion segmentation
  - **High-level**: Genre classification using LSTM over motion sequences

---

### âœ… Step 4: Key Characteristics of HDVR

- Multi-person capable (tracks multiple dancers simultaneously)
- Works without 3D labels
- Outputs interpretable motion features (e.g., movement types)
- Scalable to self-recorded dance datasets

---

## âœ… Key Insights (3-Line Summary)

* HDVR enables genre classification through 3D motion modeling without requiring 3D labels.
* The hierarchical design separates visual input, motion features, and high-level semantics.
* Ideal for explainable and lightweight dance analysis pipelines using OpenPose or BlazePose.

## ðŸ“˜ New Terms

* **HDVR**: Hierarchical Dance Video Recognition â€” the full pipeline from 2D pose to genre classification.  
* **Unsupervised 3D Pose Estimation**: Estimating 3D keypoints from 2D input without 3D supervision.

## ðŸ’­ Reflections

Todayâ€™s read gave me a clear picture of how dance genre recognition can be approached without heavy RGB or 3D annotation dependencies.  
I like that the model is structured hierarchically and is adaptable to custom data.  
It feels like a practical and interpretable setup â€” something I could implement on my own video samples in the near future.
