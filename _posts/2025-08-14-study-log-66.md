🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-08-14]**  
Focused on advanced model blending techniques in the electricity forecasting competition, documented a new urban sound-related idea, and continued paper review and SQL practice.  
Achieved another **best public LB score** with improved stability through repeated folds and seed averaging.

## 💡 Idea Generation — *Urban Noise Palette*  
Proposed a concept for mapping and visualizing **urban noise patterns** by integrating sound level meters, citizen reports, and environmental data.  
The goal is to identify high-noise areas, analyze noise sources, and support urban planning decisions to improve quality of life.

## 🏆 Competition — *Electricity Forecasting*  
Continued building-type–specific modeling with enhanced blending strategies:

| No. | Description | Local SMAPE | Public LB SMAPE |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| 36  | Split data by building type, tuned XGBoost and LightGBM via **RandomizedSearchCV**, applied **7-Fold OOF CV**, and blended predictions with optimal weights based on OOF results. *(best)* | 3.982886 | **7.1161849075** |
| 37  | Extended 36 by using **RepeatedKFold** to reduce variance, refined OOF-based weight search to 0.01 increments, and retrained with multiple seeds for **seed averaging** to mitigate overfitting. | 3.982668 | **7.0759340681** |
| 38  | Computed **fold-wise optimal weights**, blended using the **average of these weights**, and applied 5-seed averaging for further variance reduction. Preprocessing remained unchanged. | — | — |

**Best Score:** 🏆 **7.0759340681** (Experiment 37, Public LB)

## 📄 Paper Study — *Few-Shot Grounding DINO for Agriculture*  
Reviewed methods for improving object detection in agricultural contexts using **embedding-based adaptation** for few-shot scenarios.  
Focus was on how embedding space modifications enable robust classification with minimal labeled data.
