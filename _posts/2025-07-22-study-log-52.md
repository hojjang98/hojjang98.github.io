🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-07-22]**  
A productive day of multi-threaded progress: competition tuning, paper writing, new ideas, SQL theory, and project housekeeping.  
Some directions are becoming clearer — especially around personalization and explainable modeling.

## 📄 Paper Review — *Unsupervised 3D Pose Estimation for Hierarchical Dance Video Recognition*

Wrapped up Day 4 of the paper review.  
Focused on the **experiments, performance results, and conclusion/future work**.

**Key takeaways**:
- Semi-supervised 3D pose estimation achieves near SOTA accuracy (MPJPE ~47mm on Human3.6M)
- Genre classification improves most when combining 3D pose + inferred movements (F1 = 0.86)
- Future direction includes fully unsupervised training and motion-based dance synthesis

This paper continues to stand out for its modularity and practical evaluation pipeline.

## 💡 Project Idea — *Travel With Whom: Context-Aware Review Mining*

Explored a new NLP project idea centered around **classifying reviews based on travel companion context**.  
This could enrich travel recommendation systems by understanding whether a place is good for families, couples, friends, or solo travelers.

Key components:
- BERT-based context detection (e.g., “traveled with my kids”)
- Movement of sentiment by group type
- Visualization layer showing group-specific ratings
- Optional recommender layer based on travel companion profile

Promising direction for both academic application and product design.

## 📊 Competition Progress — *Electricity Usage Forecasting* ([DACON](https://dacon.io/competitions/official/236531/mysubmission))

Made significant advances on model tuning and ensemble strategies:

**Strategies applied**:

1. **RandomSearchCV tuning**  
   - Models: XGBoost, LGBM, GBR  
   - Combined via soft voting  
   - Local SMAPE: 8.88 / Public SMAPE: 17.75  

2. **Feature engineering + ensemble with hold-out validation**  
   - Added building features and time-based variables  
   - Hold-out split based on latest timestamps  
   - Local SMAPE: 17.16 / Public SMAPE: 16.15  

3. **Optuna-based tuning + final ensemble** (in progress)  
   - Tuning XGBoost, LightGBM, GBR separately  
   - Using best params for final soft-voting  
   - Hold-out split and building features applied

## 🧠 SQL Practice — Subqueries

Reviewed SQL subquery patterns:  
- Nested SELECTs inside WHERE/IN clauses  
- Correlated subqueries for row-wise conditions  
- Filtering based on aggregated comparisons  

Trying to solidify SQL foundations before I dive deeper into window functions and analytics.

## 📚 Paper Group — Direction Setting & Exploration

As part of leading our research reading group, I:

- Refined the theme: **Pose-based motion analysis for dance/action/health**
- Revisited the SEVENTEEN paper on matching rate of synchronized dance (2D + 3D evaluation)
- Skimmed a few more papers related to pose similarity and matching metrics

Planning to map these to future projects involving performance feedback and skeleton tracking.

## 🗂 GitHub Cleanup

Wrapped up the day with some repository organization:  
- Updated READMEs  
- Added clearer folder structures  
- Cleaned up old notebooks  
- Logged progress from DACON + pose-based work

Trying to maintain a clean portfolio as projects evolve.
