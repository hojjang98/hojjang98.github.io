So, I just started a new project – forecasting sales for small businesses.

Why?  
Because I actually ran my own store for over a year.  
And during that time, I kept thinking…  
**“Wouldn’t it be awesome if I could *predict* what the next week’s sales might look like?”**

This is exactly that.  
A small attempt to turn my real-world frustration into something smarter with data.

## 💡 What I'm trying to do

- Predict daily or weekly sales using past data  
- Add external factors like **weather, holidays, and day of week**  
- Eventually turn it into something that could help make decisions  
  like *when to market*, *when to hire*, or even *when to take a day off*

This isn’t just a toy problem for me —  
I know how stressful it gets when sales dip or you overprepare on a slow day.

## 🧪 What’s happening now

Right now I’m:
- setting things up on GitHub  
- drafting some ideas  
- and hunting for open datasets (💳💨)

I’ve got a few directions I want to test out —  
some models like XGBoost, maybe Prophet for time series,  
and possibly even a little Streamlit dashboard if I feel fancy later on.

## ✍️ Final thoughts

This project is part tech, part therapy.  
It’s me trying to combine what I’ve learned with what I’ve lived.

I’ll be sharing updates here as I go —  
failures included, because that’s the fun part.

Stay tuned!
