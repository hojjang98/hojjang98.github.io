🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-10-11]**  
Attended lectures on regression modeling, refined crawling logic for the ongoing **Social Sentiment Monitor** project, and deepened understanding of regression trees through hands-on exercises.

## 🎓 Class – Big Data Analysis & AI Modeling  
- Studied **Regression** and **Regression Trees** in theory and practice.  
- Learned how linear regression models predict continuous outcomes and how decision tree–based regression splits data to minimize variance.  
- Performed exercises comparing **Linear Regression**, **Ridge/Lasso**, and **Regression Trees** using real datasets.  
- **Key Takeaway:**  
  - Linear models capture global relationships, while tree-based models excel at modeling **nonlinear patterns** and **interactions**.

## 💻 Personal Project – Social Sentiment Monitor  
- Continued work on the [**Social Sentiment Monitor**](https://github.com/hojjang98/ML-Projects/tree/main/social_sentiment_monitor) project.  
- Improved the **news crawling module** to handle multiple keywords and dynamic pagination more efficiently.  
- Verified API responses and ensured stable data collection from Naver Economic News.  
- **Next Step:**  
  - Implement sentiment labeling using **KoBERT/KcELECTRA**.  
  - Begin preliminary **EDA** on crawled data to identify tone patterns across media outlets.
