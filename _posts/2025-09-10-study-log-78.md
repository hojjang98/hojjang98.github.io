🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-09-10]**  
Studied classical cryptography and positive psychology in class, and advanced my personal project on garbage classification by experimenting with CNNs and transfer learning.  

---

## 📚 Classes  
- **암호의 이해**: Learned about **classical ciphers** such as multiplicative and additive ciphers, and discussed their inherent **weaknesses**.  
- **행복심리학**: Explored the definition of **happiness**, how it is understood globally, and the **genetic conditions** that may influence happiness.  

---

## 💻 Personal Project  
- Initiated a new project: **[Garbage Classification](./recyclable-waste-classification)**  
- Downloaded and prepared dataset for recyclable waste classification.  
- Implemented a **Baseline CNN model** → achieved ~60% accuracy.  
- Improved the CNN with **regularization techniques** (Dropout, BatchNorm) → reached ~70% accuracy.  
- Explored **Transfer Learning**: initially tried **ResNet**, but ultimately used **MobileNetV2** → achieved ~80%+ accuracy, outperforming baseline models.

## ✅ TL;DR  
📍 Learned about **classical cryptography weaknesses** in "Understanding Cryptography" class  
📍 Studied **happiness definitions and genetic influences** in "Positive Psychology" class  
📍 Advanced **garbage classification project** with:  
- Baseline CNN (~60%)  
- Improved CNN (~70%)  
- Transfer Learning (ResNet tried, MobileNetV2 used → ~80%+)
