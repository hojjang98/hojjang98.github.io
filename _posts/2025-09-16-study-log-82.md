🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-09-16]**  
Learned classical substitution ciphers in cryptography, explored positive psychology foundations, discussed creativity strategies in AI convergence, developed a new lifestyle idea, and began studying diffusion models in vision.  

---

## 📚 Classes  
- **Cryptography**: Studied **classical substitution ciphers** such as **Hill cipher** and **Polybius square cipher**, gaining insight into their **mathematical foundations**.  
- **Positive Psychology**: Learned about the definition and framework of **positive psychology** introduced by **Martin Seligman**, focusing on its role in well-being.  
- **AI Creative Convergence Strategy**: Explored the nature of **creativity** and discussed methods for fostering **creative idea generation** in individuals and organizations.

## 💡 Idea  
- Proposed a new lifestyle idea: **[Pants First](https://github.com/hojjang98/ideas/blob/main/lifestyle/pants_first.md)**  
- Inspired by the challenge of coordinating outfits starting from pants when preparing to go out.  
- Aims to streamline **outfit matching** and reduce time spent choosing clothes.  

---

## 📖 Paper Study  
- Began study of **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)**.  
- Key insights:  
  - Diffusion reframes **image generation** as a **denoising process**.  
  - Training is stable compared to GANs and avoids mode collapse.  
  - The **forward process** adds Gaussian noise; the **reverse process** learns to remove it step by step.  
  - Achieved **state-of-the-art results** on CIFAR-10 and LSUN at the time of publication.
