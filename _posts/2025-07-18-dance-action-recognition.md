## ðŸ§  Day 2 Review â€” Computational Approach (Section 2)

### âœ… Step 1: 2D Pose Estimation & Tracking

Each frame \( I(t) \) is processed to estimate 2D poses \( \hat{p}^i(t) \) using OpenPose.  
Bounding boxes \( B^i(t) = (x, y, w, l) \) are used to track each dancer using the LDES tracker, maintaining per-person histograms and motion info.

---

### âœ… Step 2: Overlap Handling via Motion & Histogram

When tracking fails (e.g., due to occlusion), the algorithm detects overlap by checking directional changes in movement.  
It then predicts where the overlap will end, and re-assigns the correct dancer by comparing appearance histograms in the predicted frame.

---

### âœ… Step 3: 2D Pose Selection After Overlap

After overlap ends, multiple poses might be present in the bounding box.  
The pose most similar to the previous frameâ€™s histogram is selected to maintain temporal consistency.

## âœ… Key Insights (3-Line Summary)

* The paper uses a robust 3-step tracking algorithm to handle occlusion between dancers.
* LDES tracker, motion prediction, and histogram matching ensure consistent identity tracking.
* OpenPose is used to estimate poses, but augmented with intelligent re-identification logic.

---

## ðŸ“˜ New Terms

* **LDES Tracker**: A tracking method (cited as [16]) used to predict object positions across frames in low-dimensional appearance space.
* **Histogram Matching**: Comparing color distributions of bounding boxes across time to resolve identity conflicts.

## ðŸ’­ Reflections

This section gave a clear overview of how the authors handle the multi-dancer tracking problem, which is critical for dance recognition.  
The idea of using histogram-based re-identification after occlusion feels both lightweight and practical.  
I still want to understand the LDES tracker in more detailâ€”will check citation [16] later for its internals.
