🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-09-17]**  
Learned statistical model comparison in EDA, explored full-cycle big data practices, studied Havruta-style AI discussions, proposed an IoT-connected alarm idea, and continued diffusion model paper review (forward process).

## 📚 Classes  
- **Big Data Analysis & AI Modeling**: Learned how to perform **EDA based on statistics**, compare multiple models statistically, and apply **interpretation methodologies** for those models.  
- **Big Data Practical Analysis**: Covered the **end-to-end workflow** in enterprise settings, from **data importing to storage strategies**, mirroring real-world corporate practices.  
- **AI-based Havruta Education**: Explored the **Havruta (Jewish dialogic learning)** method and practiced **AI-assisted discussions** to deepen understanding and generate new perspectives.

## 💡 Idea  
- Proposed a new lifestyle idea: **[IoT Connected Alarm](https://github.com/hojjang98/ideas/blob/main/lifestyle/IoT_connected_alarm.md)**  
- Motivation: Difficulty in waking up despite existing footpad alarms.  
- Concept: Upgrade traditional alarm platforms with **IoT connectivity**, integrating with other devices to enhance wake-up effectiveness.

## 📖 Paper Study  
- Continued study of **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)**.  
- **Day 2 – Forward Process (Noising)**  
  - The forward process **gradually corrupts data with Gaussian noise** in a Markov chain until it becomes pure noise.  
  - **Key properties**: no learning required, direct access to noisy samples, guaranteed convergence to Gaussian noise.  
  - Intuition: like repeatedly adding static to a photo until all original content disappears.  
  - Insight: This provides a **clear blueprint** for the reverse process, giving the model a structured task to learn.
