title: "🚢 Titanic Project – EDA Complete & Missing Values Handled"
date: 2025-04-26
---

Today I officially kicked off my **Titanic Survival Prediction** project 🚀  
I focused on **understanding the data** and **cleaning it up properly**.

---

## 🔍 What I accomplished today

1. Loaded the `train` and `test` datasets  
2. Inspected the data structures and distributions (`head()`, `info()`, `describe(include='all')`)  
3. Identified and handled missing values:
   - `Age`: Filled with median values
   - `Embarked`: Dropped rows with missing values (only 2)
   - `Fare`: Dropped row with missing value (only 1 in test set)
   - `Cabin`: Created a new binary feature (`Has_Cabin`) and dropped the original column
4. Confirmed there are **no missing values** remaining in both train and test datasets

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

> **Effective EDA isn’t just about pretty charts — it’s about preparing clean, model-ready data.**  
> Today I made sure the dataset is clean and ready for feature engineering.

---

## 🧩 Next Steps

- Create new features:
  - Extract `Title` from `Name`
  - Calculate `FamilySize` from `SibSp` and `Parch`
- Explore additional feature engineering ideas
- Begin baseline modeling

> Feels great to clear the first major hurdle 🏁  
> Let's engineer some powerful features next!
