🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-07-10]**  
Wasn’t feeling too great today, so I kept the pace light.  
Still managed to stay consistent with TOEIC, read Day 2 of EfficientNet, and pushed a new SCU_Competition submission forward.

## 📊 SCU_Competition — Submission #78

**Focus**:  
- Added new derived features while keeping the winning structure (VotingClassifier 6:2:2)  
- Minor adjustments to feature importance threshold for pruning  
- Used same clustering features from best model (#73)

**Result**:  
- ✅ Local AUC slightly improved  
- ✅ Kaggle AUC still very stable — no major breakthroughs but steady performance  

**Reflection**:  
- Feature richness is key, not excessive weight tuning  
- Will try Feature Selection with feature importance next

## 🧠 TOEIC Study — Daily Routine

**Tasks Completed**:  
- Covered the scheduled units from both listening and grammar books  
- Focused on pacing and answer consistency

**Reflection**:  
- Sticking to small daily progress is keeping the pressure low  
- Plan to finish at least 5 more units this week

## 📘 Paper Study — EfficientNet (Day 2)

**Focus**:  
- Studied **architecture details** and **scaling coefficients (ϕ, α, β, γ)**  
- Understood how EfficientNet scales depth, width, and resolution in sync  
- Took notes on B0–B7 variants and scaling rationale

**Reflection**:  
- The compound scaling logic is elegant and intuitive  
- Excited to explore the **NAS-based model discovery** in the next part

## ❌ Skipped: CV Chapter 2

Unfortunately had to skip today's CV study due to fatigue.  
Planning to resume tomorrow with hands-on experiments from Chapter 2.

---

## 🔍 Tomorrow’s Plan

- ✅ Continue SCU_Competition submission tuning (try Feature Selection)
- ✅ EfficientNet Day 3: Experiments & Results  
- ✅ Resume CV study — backprop code and basic layer implementations  
- ✅ TOEIC: maintain daily progress

---

## ✅ TL;DR

📍 **SCU**: Submission #78 — stable performance, more feature tuning ahead  
📍 **TOEIC**: Kept up with listening and grammar units  
📍 **Paper**: EfficientNet Day 2 — compound scaling mechanics covered  
📍 **CV**: Skipped today — back on track tomorrow  
📍 **Tomorrow**: Tune, train, and catch up on skipped CV work
