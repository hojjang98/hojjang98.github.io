🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-07-09]**  
Feeling better today and finally picked up some solid momentum.  
Made five new submissions for the SCU_Competition, reviewed SQL normalization theory, cleaned up my CV code for Chapter 2, and completed Day 1 of the EfficientNet paper study.

## 📊 SCU_Competition — Submission Marathon

**Focus**: Rebalanced ensemble weights and tested feature interaction sets  
- ✅ Submitted **5 new experiments** — mostly variations of VotingClassifier weights (e.g., 6:2:2, 7:1.5:1.5, 8:1:1)  
- ✅ Best Kaggle AUC: **0.9002** — finally crossed the 0.9 milestone 🎉  
- ✅ Used a combination of strong feature engineering and light clustering  
- Also cleaned up noisy features and re-validated interaction terms

**Reflection**:  
- VotingClassifier remains the most stable approach  
- Overweighting a single model can hurt generalization  
- The key is not complexity, but well-structured feature design

## 🧠 SQL Study — Normalization & Denormalization

**Topics Covered**:  
- Reviewed **1NF, 2NF, 3NF** with examples  
- Compared normalization vs. denormalization: trade-offs and use cases  
- Discussed how denormalization may help query performance in practice

**Reflection**:  
- The concepts were familiar but felt more grounded this time  
- Realized that database design is not about correctness alone — it's about context and intent

## 📘 Paper Study — EfficientNet (Day 1 Completed)

**Focus**:  
- Finished reading and summarizing Abstract, Introduction, and Motivation  
- Deep-dived into the concept of **compound scaling**  
- Cleaned up the LaTeX-style math to be **GitHub Pages compatible** using `$$...$$` syntax

**Reflection**:  
- Having already read MobileNetV2, this paper felt like a natural next step  
- Looking forward to Day 2: exploring architecture details and scaling coefficients

---

## 👁️ CV Study — DL4VS Chapter 2 (Backprop, Basic Layers)

**Tasks Completed**:  
- Read through Chapter 2: activation functions, FC/Conv layers  
- Implemented **manual backpropagation** and verified gradients  
- Wrote minimal code blocks to better understand forward/backward passes

**Reflection**:  
- Much more practical than Chapter 1  
- Feels like I'm building foundational blocks for later experiments

---

## 🔍 Tomorrow’s Plan

- ✅ Push SCU_Competition toward submission #80  
- ✅ EfficientNet Day 2: architectural breakdown and B0–B7 scaling  
- ✅ Finish Chapter 2 code and launch initial experiment  
- ✅ Explore real-world SQL schema patterns (JOIN optimization, denormalized designs)

## ✅ TL;DR

📍 **SCU**: 5 new submissions — hit 0.9002 AUC for the first time!  
📍 **SQL**: Reviewed normalization vs. denormalization from a practical angle  
📍 **Paper**: EfficientNet Day 1 done — compound scaling makes sense now  
📍 **CV**: Chapter 2 progress — implemented backprop manually  
📍 **Tomorrow**: Another day of experiments, theory, and code
