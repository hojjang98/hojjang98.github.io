🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-10-10]**  
Generated a new self-reflective idea, studied the **InternVideo2 (Day 3)** pretraining setup, and started a new **economic sentiment analysis project** comparing media tone with real market indicators.

## 💡 Idea  
- Proposed [**Mirror Planner – Visual Reflection Meets Productivity**](https://github.com/hojjang98/ideas/blob/main/self-insight/mirror_planner.md).  
- Inspired by the habit of **writing on a whiteboard** and **self-reflection in front of a mirror**.  
- Integrates the SAVERS routine’s **A (Affirmation)** and **V (Visualization)** components into a **mirror-based planning tool**, encouraging both goal-setting and mindful self-checking.

## 📖 Paper Study – InternVideo2 (CVPR 2024, Day 3)  
- Studied **Pretraining Setup & Datasets** section of *InternVideo2: Scaling Video Foundation Models for Multimodal Understanding*.  
- **Key Insights:**  
  - Scaled pretraining on **InternVid-400M**, one of the largest video–text datasets.  
  - Three-stage pretraining pipeline:  
    1. **Masked Video Modeling (MVM):** spatial-temporal representation learning.  
    2. **Multimodal Contrastive Learning (CL):** alignment across video, text, audio, and speech.  
    3. **Next-Token Prediction (GEN):** enables generative multimodal reasoning.  
  - **Fine-tuning Tasks:** video-text retrieval, action recognition, captioning, and AVQA.  
- **Findings:**  
  - Massive and diverse data greatly improves zero-shot generalization.  
  - Training uses **DeepSpeed**, **FlashAttention**, and **FP16/BF16 precision** for efficiency.  
- **Takeaway:**  
  - Multimodal scaling and progressive curriculum are key to robust video foundation models.

## 💻 Personal Project – Social Sentiment Monitor  
- Initiated new project: **Social Sentiment Monitor – Economic Sentiment vs. Market Reality**.  
- **Goal:** Analyze emotional tone of **economic news** and compare with **market indices (KODEX200, KOSPI)**.  
- **Pipeline Overview:**  
  1. Crawl Naver economic news (keywords: economy, inflation, interest rate, etc.).  
  2. Apply **KoBERT** / **KcELECTRA** for sentiment classification.  
  3. Collect market data from **Yahoo Finance** (`yfinance`).  
  4. Compare **sentiment trends** with **market movements** through visualization & correlation.  
- **Expected Outcome:**  
  - Determine if negative sentiment precedes market downturns.  
  - Identify outlet-specific tone bias.  
  - Explore causal patterns (e.g., Granger causality).  
- **Next Step:**  
  - Complete news crawling & sentiment labeling within Week 1 and Week 2 milestones.
