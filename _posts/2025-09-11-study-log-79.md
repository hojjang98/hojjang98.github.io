🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-09-11]**  
Explored AI-based education strategies and creative AI business planning in class, developed a new lifestyle idea, deepened understanding of the Transformer paper, and tested skeleton extraction for motion analysis in the study group.  

---

## 📚 Classes  
- **AI기반하브루타토론교육**: Studied the **excellence of Havruta-style education** and how it fosters deep learning and critical thinking.  
- **AI창의융합 전략**: Learned strategies for **AI-driven entrepreneurship**, including drafting **business plans** for the AI era. Both topics were highly engaging and thought-provoking.  

---

## 💡 Idea
