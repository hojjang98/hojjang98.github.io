Today, I finally launched my GitHub blog!

I actually created this a while ago, but kept putting it off using “being busy” as an excuse.  
From now on, I'm going to try updating it more regularly.

Starting something new is always a bit tricky, but there’s a certain joy in building structure step by step.

I'll be sharing things like machine learning projects, notes from my studies, and whatever else I’m exploring.

Let’s see how this journey unfolds 😄
