## âœ… Day 2 â€“ Method

Today I reviewed the **Method** section of the paper, focusing on how the authors modify Grounding-DINO to enable parameter-efficient, prompt-free few-shot learning.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Overview

The proposed method adapts a pre-trained **Grounding-DINO** for agricultural datasets by:
- **Removing** the BERT text encoder
- **Replacing** it with **randomly initialized, learnable text embeddings** per class
- **Freezing** all other parameters
- **Fine-tuning only the embeddings**, enabling fast adaptation with minimal labeled data

---

### 3.1 Grounding-DINO

**Core Architecture**:
- **Image Backbone**: Swin Transformer extracts hierarchical image features.  
- **Text Backbone**: BERT encoder converts BPE-tokenized text into \(N \times 768\) embeddings.  
- **Feature Enhancer**: Self-attention and cross-attention layers fuse image and text features.  
- **Language-Guided Query Selection**: Selects top-\(N_I\) image features by dot product with text features.  
- **Cross-Modality Decoder**: Refines queries with alternating self- and cross-attention, outputs boxes & classes.

**Losses**:
- Classification: contrastive loss + focal loss  
- Localization: L1 + GIoU loss  
- Matching: bipartite matching (DETR-like)  
- Total loss: weighted sum of classification and localization terms

---

### 3.2 Zero-shot Approach

- Uses pre-trained Grounding-DINO **without fine-tuning**.  
- Text prompts created as:
  - **Single words** separated by periods (e.g., `"crop . weed ."`).
  - **Phrases** for better disambiguation (e.g., `"green pepper . red pepper ."`).
- During inference:
  1. Compute dot product between token embeddings and object features.
  2. Assign class based on highest-scoring token within the prompt set.

---

### 3.3 Few-shot Approach (Proposed)

**Motivation**:
- Prompt crafting in agriculture is difficult due to vocabulary size and subtle class differences.

**Design**:
- Remove BERT encoder; operate directly in BERTâ€™s \(768\)-dimensional output space.
- Introduce \((C \times T + 2) \times 768\) learnable embeddings:
  - \(C\): number of classes
  - \(T\): embeddings per class
  - +2: start and end tokens
- Apply position IDs & attention masks mimicking BERT.
- Freeze all other parameters.

**Training Process**:
1. Extract:
   - \(N_I\): object query features (\(X_I\))
   - \(N_T\): text embeddings (\(X_T\))
2. Compute:
   $$
   P_{\text{out}} = \sigma(X_I X_T^T), \quad P_{\text{out}} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_I \times N_T}
   $$
3. Define \(P_{\text{gt}}\): 1 for correct class tokens, else 0.
4. Total loss:
   $$
   L = 1 \cdot L_{\text{cls}} + 5 \cdot L_1 + 2 \cdot L_{\text{giou}}
   $$
5. Perform bipartite matching:
   $$
   \hat{\sigma} = \arg\min_{\sigma} \sum_{i=1}^N L(y_i, \hat{y}_{\sigma(i)})
   $$
6. Update only embeddings \(W\):
   $$
   W_{t+1} = W_t - \eta \nabla_W L_{\hat{\sigma}}(y, \hat{y})
   $$

**Initialization**:
- Random normal distribution  
- Comparable performance to prompt-based initialization  
- No manual prompt crafting, lower computational cost

### ðŸ“Œ Advantages

- **Prompt-free**: Removes dependence on text descriptions  
- **Parameter-efficient**: Only a few thousand parameters trained  
- **Low-data requirement**: Works with as few as two labeled images per class  
- **Cross-domain adaptability**: Quickly adapts a single model to diverse datasets

**Right (Few-shot)**:

- **Dashed box**: Removed BERT encoder  
- **Backpropagation**: Only into text embeddings; rest of the model is frozen

---

### ðŸ§  Final Thoughts

The method offers a **lightweight, scalable, and prompt-free** way to adapt Grounding-DINO to new agricultural datasets.  
By freezing most of the model and fine-tuning only a small embedding set, it achieves **fast adaptation** with minimal data, while retaining strong cross-domain generalization.
