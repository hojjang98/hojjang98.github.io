🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-07-05]**  
Today's focus was SCU_Competition experimentation (submission 56–60), plus structured TOEIC study (Listening Unit 2, Reading Unit 2–3).

## 📊 SCU_Competition — Submission 56–60

**Focus**: StackingClassifier revisited, cluster augmentation, noise filtering, and explosive feature engineering  
**Goal**: Push leaderboard AUC to new peak via structure vs feature trade-off

**Highlights**:
- **Submission 56**: StackingClassifier with LGBM meta-model  
  → **CV AUC: 0.8617 / Kaggle AUC: 0.8898**  
- **Submission 57**: Voting (5:3:2) with added `구매패턴_클러스터`  
  → **CV AUC: 0.8807 / Kaggle AUC: 0.8956**  
- **Submission 58**: Voting with cluster count increased (n_clusters=6)  
  → **CV AUC: 0.8808 / Kaggle AUC: 0.8948**  
- **Submission 59**: Pruned bottom 10% of features by importance  
  → **CV AUC: 0.8816 / Kaggle AUC: 0.8953**  
- **Submission 60**: Added 10+ new derived features (ratios, interactions)  
  → **CV AUC: 0.8788 / Kaggle AUC: 0.8973 🔥**

**Next Ideas**:
- Try simplified model using top-30 features  
- OneHot encode cluster labels  
- Test LGBM+RF-only ensemble (drop LR)

## 📘 TOEIC Study — Listening & Reading Practice

**Focus Areas**:
- 🎧 **Listening Unit 2**: Short Conversations  
  - Practiced identifying speaker intent, setting, and logical flow  
  - Noted traps around similar-sounding words and indirect suggestions  
- 📖 **Reading Unit 2–3**: Vocabulary-in-Context & Inference  
  - Focused on identifying transition words (e.g., however, therefore)  
  - Applied skimming/scanning to long paragraphs for targeted answers  
  - Improved confidence on inference-type questions  

**Reflection**:
- Listening speed still fast but improving  
- Reading was much smoother today — vocabulary context clues are getting clearer  
- Unit-based practice feels more productive than random full-tests

## ✅ TL;DR

📍 **SCU**: Submission 60 nearly beat the all-time best — feature engineering wins  
📍 **TOEIC**: Focused on Listening Unit 2 + Reading Unit 2–3 — better structure & flow
