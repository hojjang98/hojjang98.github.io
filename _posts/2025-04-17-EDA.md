title: "🍗 District-Level EDA – How Much Do Chicken Shops Make?"
date: 2025-04-17
---

Following yesterday’s macro-level dive into industry trends,  
today I zoomed in on a **specific category** that hits close to home:  
**치킨전문점 (Chicken Restaurants).**

Why?  
Because I used to run one — and I want to know which areas of Seoul would’ve made me rich (or bankrupt) 😅

## 🔍 What I explored today

1. **Filtered the dataset to only include chicken restaurants**  
2. **Grouped sales by 행정동 (administrative district)**  
   - Calculated: average sales, standard deviation, data count (number of quarters), and CV (coefficient of variation)  
3. **Sorted districts by total average sales**  
   - 역삼1동 and 종로1·2·3·4가동 top the list, with over ₩12 billion in yearly sales  
4. Clarified that:
   - Sales values are **per quarter**, and  
   - They represent the **total revenue across all chicken shops** in that district

## 🧠 Insights

- Some districts generate incredible volume — but that doesn’t mean every shop wins  
- CV (변동계수) shows how stable or risky each location might be  
- Realized I’d need **store count** data to estimate **per-shop profitability**

## 🔗 External Tool

Found a great external data source: [서울 골목상권 분석 서비스](https://golmok.seoul.go.kr/stateArea.do)  
It shows the **number of registered businesses per district**.  
This will be essential for calculating *"How much does the average shop make?"*

---

## 🧩 Next Steps

- Manually collect chicken shop counts from the external source  
- Merge with sales data to estimate **revenue per store**
- Use this to rank districts by potential profitability
