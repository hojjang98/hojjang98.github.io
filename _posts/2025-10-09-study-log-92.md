## 💡 Idea  
- Proposed [**Cup Sense – How Often Should I Wash My Cup?**](https://github.com/hojjang98/ideas/blob/main/fun/cup_sense.md).  
- A fun concept visualizing how often a person washes their cup, combining **data tracking** and **gamified feedback** to encourage better hygiene habits.

## 📖 Paper Study – InternVideo2 (CVPR 2024, Day 2)  
- Reviewed *InternVideo2: Scaling Video Foundation Models for Multimodal Understanding*.  
- **Key Takeaways:**  
  - Unified **spatiotemporal–multimodal architecture** combining video, text, and audio.  
  - Two main modules:  
    - **Cross-Modal Fusion Module (CMFM):** Enables adaptive information exchange.  
    - **Hierarchical Temporal Encoder (HTE):** Efficiently captures long-term motion.  
  - Trains with **progressive multitask pretraining** — reconstruction, alignment, and generation.  
- **Findings:**  
  - Improved **temporal reasoning**, **cross-modal alignment**, and **video–language generalization**.  
  - Still requires large-scale data and compute.  
- **Future Direction:**  
  - Explore **adapter-based fine-tuning** and **lightweight multimodal extensions**.

## 🧠 Research Progress – Pose-Based Dance Evaluation  
- Planned next actions for the **dance evaluation** study:  
  - Collect additional **motion data** for upcoming experiments.  
  - Search potential **academic conferences** for submission.  
  - Research **dance generation models** for comparative analysis.  
- **Additional Ideas:**  
  - Extract **optimal BPM** and compare with music for alignment accuracy.  
  - Measure **BPM error by body part** to analyze rhythmic precision.  
  - Include **expert qualitative feedback** to identify key skeletal points.  
- Implemented a new code module to test these ideas.  

---

## 📝 Resume Update  
- Updated and refined both **Korean and English resumes**.  
- Improved structure, flow, and expression.  
- Added recent projects, competition results, and research activities.
