üß† **Daily Study Log [2025-07-18]**  
Today was a diverse study day across ideation, coding practice, paper review, and spatial data exploration.  
I'm also considering transitioning this blog into a more polished portfolio over time.

## üß† Project: *Seoul Youth Footprint ‚Äî Mapping Young Mobility for Smarter Urban Policy*

This project explores where young people in Seoul actually spend their time using vehicle ownership stats and optionally GPS-based voluntary tracking.  
It aims to support location-aware youth programs by revealing movement patterns that go beyond traditional demographic targeting.

**Problem**:  
Policy decisions often rely on static population data, ignoring behavioral patterns like actual destinations and emerging urban spaces popular with youth.

**Approach**:  
- Gather youth vehicle data and demographics from public portals  
- Tag Points of Interest (POIs) and apply clustering  
- Optionally include consent-based GPS samples for richer movement profiles  
- Visualize on maps to guide youth-centered programs and infrastructure planning

## üó∫ GIS Project: *Seoul Smoking Zone Mapping*

This project visualizes **designated public smoking zones** in Seoul, starting with **Yongsan-gu**.  
It uses open data and geocoding to plot real-world coordinates and supports policy transparency.

**Scope**:  
Only districts with usable coordinate-level data are included (Yongsan-gu for now). Other areas will be added as data quality permits.

**Purpose**:  
- Inform public health planning  
- Analyze spatial clustering of legal zones  
- Serve as a base for potential zone recommendations or impact studies

## üìÑ Paper Review ‚Äî *Unsupervised 3D Pose Estimation for Hierarchical Dance Video Recognition*

**Focus**: Section 2 ‚Äî Computational Approach  
**Link**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09166](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09166)  
**Repo**: [github.com/hojjang98/Paper-Review](https://github.com/hojjang98/Paper-Review)

**Reflection**:  
Today's section introduced a 3-stage dancer tracking algorithm that handles occlusion using motion prediction and histogram matching.  
The approach is elegant and practical, especially in crowded multi-person dance scenarios.  
Next up: the adversarial 3D pose lifting part, which seems more technical and will require closer attention.

## üß† SQL Practice ‚Äî Query Prediction & Debugging

**What I Did**:  
Practiced predicting SQL query results before execution and focused on error tracing without relying on outputs. Worked with JOINs, GROUP BY, HAVING, and subqueries.

**Insights**:  
- Training yourself to **guess the output** sharpens schema understanding  
- Misuse of HAVING vs WHERE is still a recurring bug  
- Will continue refining logic-driven query thinking

## ‚úÖ TL;DR

üìç **Project**: Designed a youth mobility analysis project using behavioral + vehicle data  
üìç **GIS**: Started mapping legal smoking zones ‚Äî currently Yongsan-gu only  
üìç **Paper**: Learned occlusion-aware tracking in dance recognition pipeline  
üìç **SQL**: Focused on query logic without running them ‚Äî great debugging exercise

üí° **Note**: I‚Äôm considering turning this blog into a more portfolio-style archive of projects, not just logs. The formatting and content depth will gradually reflect that shift.
