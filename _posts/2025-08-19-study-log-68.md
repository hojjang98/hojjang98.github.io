🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-08-19]**  
Generated a new idea, practiced SQL problems intensively for the upcoming exam, conducted multiple competition experiments with blending strategies, wrapped up Day 4 of the few-shot adaptation paper with conclusions and future work, created a small adapter implementation, and archived the Bass Seeker project with reflections on coding practices.

## 💡 Idea Generation — *Pink Sky Predictor*  
Proposed an idea that explores predicting the occurrence of **pink skies** using weather and environmental data.  
This project concept combines atmospheric science with aesthetic prediction.

## 💾 SQL Practice  
Continued preparing for the certification exam on **August 23**, focusing on solving **past exam problems**.  
Emphasis on query optimization and handling multi-table join scenarios.

## 🏆 Competition — *Electricity Forecasting*  
Conducted several experiments refining **building-type–specific models** and blending methods:

| No. | Description | Local SMAPE | Public LB SMAPE |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| 39  | Best score: tuned **XGB/LGBM** via RS-CV for each building type, computed fold-wise optimal weights on **7-Fold OOF**, averaged them, and retrained with **5 different seeds** for seed averaging. *(best)* | 4.065438 | **7.0021252141** |
| 40  | Integrated flexible folds, negative prediction clipping, standardized LGBM params, adaptive weight shrinkage, and 5-seed averaging into a unified codebase. | 4.370971 | **7.0118167688** |
| 41  | Used RS-CV per building type, blended fold-wise weights with **trimmed mean + shrink**, and applied 5-seed averaging. | 12.496758 | **6.9964770263** |
| 42  | Partitioned by building type, tuned with lightweight RS-CV (*n_iter=6*), blended with trimmed mean + shrink, applied 3-seed averaging and post-processing (0/top clipping, building-level median filter, OOF bias correction). | 12.553428 | **15.1738844787** |
| 43  | Single-model XGB with RS-CV (*n_iter=8*), TimeSeriesSplit(7) OOF validation, 5-seed averaging, and building-level median filtering. Disabled bias/top clipping for leaderboard safety. | 16.282731 | **7.1981428039** |

**Best Score:** 🏆 **7.0021252141** (Experiment 39, Public LB)

## 📄 Paper Study — *Few-Shot Grounding DINO for Agriculture (Day 4)*  
Reviewed **Conclusion, Limitations, and Future Work** of the paper.  

- **Conclusion:** Proposed a **few-shot embedding adaptation** method, replacing text prompts with learnable embeddings, achieving strong improvements over zero-shot and full fine-tuning baselines.  
- **Limitations:** 1-shot unstable, challenges in complex tasks, sensitive to hyperparameters.  
- **Future Work:** Cross-domain extension (e.g., medical imaging), hierarchical embeddings, temporal/segmentation tasks, and hybrid fine-tuning.  

Additionally, implemented a **small adapter module** to explore the idea hands-on.

## 🎶 Personal Project — *Bass Seeker (Archived)*  
Archived the **Bass Seeker** project.  
🔗 [Archive Link](https://github.com/hojjang98/Archive-Projects/tree/main/bass_seeker)  

Reflection after participating in the **Strawberry competition**:  
- Realized gaps in code understanding and clarity.  
- Moving forward, I plan to write code more carefully and thoroughly understand every component.
