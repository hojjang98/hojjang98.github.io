🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-09-19]**  
Planned a 6-week research roadmap for the color–pose study, proposed an **AI-Guard** idea against scams, and reviewed DDPM experimental results showing state-of-the-art performance.  

---

## 💡 Idea  
- Proposed **[AI-Guard](https://github.com/hojjang98/ideas/blob/main/society/ai_guard.md)**  
- Concept: A system to **detect and prevent AI-related scams**, ensuring authenticity and safety in everyday use.  

---

## 📖 Paper Study  
- Continued **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)** study.  
- **Day 4 – Experiments & Results**  
  - Achieved **state-of-the-art FID/IS** on CIFAR-10, competitive results on LSUN & CelebA HQ.  
  - Generated images were sharp, diverse, and stable without GAN-like mode collapse.  
  - Demonstrated diffusion models as a strong alternative to GANs for image synthesis.

## 🏆 Research Plan – Color × Pose Estimation  
- Outlined a **6-week study plan**:  
  - Week 1: Finalized research question & dataset design  
  - Week 2: Dancer shooting under color/background conditions  
  - Week 3: Skeleton extraction pipeline setup  
  - Week 4: Color quantification + preliminary analysis  
  - Week 5: Statistical testing (ANOVA, correlation)  
  - Week 6: Paper writing & result discussion

## ✅ TL;DR  
📍 New idea: **AI-Guard** against scams  
📍 DDPM shows **GAN-level or better** results with stable training  
📍 Planned **6-week roadmap** for color–pose estimation study
