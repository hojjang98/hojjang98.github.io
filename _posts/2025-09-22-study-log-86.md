🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-09-22]**  
Explored the idea of **scenic bus routes**, wrapped up DDPM study with key conclusions, and summarized results from the **Garbage Classification** project.

---

## 💡 Idea  
- Proposed **[Scenic Bus Routes](https://github.com/hojjang98/ideas/blob/main/travel/scenic_bus_routes.md)**  
- Concept: Evaluate bus routes not just for efficiency, but also for **beautiful scenery**, offering unique value for tourists and daily commuters.

## 📖 Paper Study  
- Continued **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)** study.  
- **Day 5 – Discussion & Conclusion**  
  - Diffusion models = **simple, stable, and strong alternative** to GANs/VAEs.  
  - Strengths: stability, theoretical links to score matching & Langevin dynamics.  
  - Weaknesses: slow sampling, heavy compute cost.  
  - Future: faster sampling methods (DDIM, latent diffusion), wider domains (audio/video/text), hybrid generative models.  
  - Final takeaway: **“Add noise → learn to remove it”**, foundation for Stable Diffusion, Imagen, DALL·E 2.

## 🗑️ Personal Project – Garbage Classification  
- **Goal**: Classify waste images (6 categories) with CNN & transfer learning.  
- **Dataset**: Kaggle Garbage Classification (~2,500 images, 6 classes).  
- **Methods**:  
  - Baseline CNN → ~60% accuracy  
  - MobileNetV2 (frozen) → ~78%  
  - MobileNetV2 (fine-tuned) → ~84%  
- **Findings**:  
  - Strong gains with transfer learning.  
  - Weakest class = *trash* (recall ~62%).  
  - Frequent confusion: plastic ↔ glass.  
- **Limitations**: Small dataset, class imbalance, webcam input less reliable.  
- **Next Steps**: More augmentation, background removal, test stronger models (EfficientNetV2, ViT).

## ✅ TL;DR  
📍 New idea: **Scenic Bus Routes** for tourists & commuters  
📍 Finished DDPM: strong alternative to GANs, foundation for modern diffusion models  
📍 Garbage Classification: MobileNetV2 achieved ~84%, but needs better handling of class imbalance
