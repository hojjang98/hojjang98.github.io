🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-10-06]**  
Focused on internship preparation, generated a new computer vision idea, and completed **Day 4** of the Vision Transformer paper with final reflections.

---

## 📄 Coursework / Activities  
- **Internship Preparation**  
  - Treated the internship application process as a form of self-study and reflection.  
  - Spent significant time refining materials and reviewing career goals.  

---

## 💡 Idea  
- Proposed **[Layout Lens](https://github.com/hojjang98/ideas/blob/main/computer-vision/layout_lens.md)**.  
- Focus: Instead of improving content alone, this idea emphasizes **visual coherence**—unifying font, alignment, and layout aesthetics in resumes.  
- Inspired by the insight that subtle design consistency can convey professionalism beyond words.

## 📖 Paper Study – Vision Transformer (ViT)  
- **Day 4 – Discussion & Conclusion**  
  - Highlighted ViT’s **scalability**, **simplicity**, and **global attention mechanism** as its main strengths.  
  - Recognized limitations: **data hunger** and **high computational cost** for large-scale pretraining.  
  - Concluded that ViT proves the **scaling law of Transformers** extends effectively to vision tasks, but remains resource-intensive for small-scale use.

## ✅ TL;DR  
📍 Treated internship prep as personal growth and reflection  
📍 Created new idea *Layout Lens* focusing on visual design quality  
📍 Completed ViT Day 4: scalability proven, but costly and data-heavy
