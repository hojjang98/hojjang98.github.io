## ðŸ§  Day 3 Review â€” 3D Pose Estimation & Genre Classification (Sections 2.2 ~ 2.4)

This session covers the core methodology behind 3D pose lifting, body part motion recognition, and final genre classification.  
The paper presents a fully unsupervised approach, structured into three stages: (1) 3D Pose Estimation, (2) Body Part Motion Modeling, and (3) Genre Classification.

### ðŸ”¹ Section 2.2 â€” 3D Pose Estimation via Multi-Seed Optimization

The 2D keypoints are lifted to 3D pose representations without any 3D ground truth.  
To address the ambiguity of this inverse problem, the authors introduce a **multi-seed optimization strategy**:

- Generate multiple candidate 3D poses $${ \{P_t^k, w_t^k\} }$$
- Evaluate each candidate with a composite loss function
- Select the best pose seed $${ k^* }$$ using total error minimization:

$$
k^* = \arg\min_k \sum_t e_t^k
$$

$$
\hat{P}_t = P_t^{k^*}, \quad w_t = w_t^{k^*}
$$

**Loss Terms**:

- 2D Reprojection:  
  $$
  L_{2D} = \| \hat{p}_t - p_t \|
  $$

- 2D Smoothness:  
  $$
  L_{\text{smooth2D}} = \| \hat{p}_t - \hat{p}_{t-1} \|
  $$

- 3D Smoothness:  
  $$
  L_{\text{smooth3D}} = \| \hat{P}_t - \hat{P}_{t-1} \|
  $$

- 3D Consistency:  
  $$
  L_{3D} = \| \hat{P}_t - P_t^* \|
  $$

This strategy enables **unsupervised, temporally coherent 3D pose reconstruction** from 2D keypoints.

### ðŸ”¹ Section 2.3 â€” Body Part Movement Recognition

Each body part $e \in E$ is associated with its own LSTM model to recognize basic motion types over time.

- **Input**: 3D joint trajectories for the joints $j \in J_e$

$$
\left\{ \left\{ \hat{p}_t^j \right\}_{j \in J_e} \right\}_{t=0}^{T-1}
$$

- **Output**: Multi-label motion vector per time step

$$
\left\{ \hat{y}_t^e \right\}_{t=0}^{T-1}
$$

- **Loss Function**: Binary cross-entropy for each body part

$$
L_{\text{BCE}}^e = \text{BCE}\left( \left\{ \hat{y}_t^e \right\}, \left\{ y_t^e \right\} \right)
$$

This component models the **localized movement patterns** across different body regions in a time-aware manner.

### ðŸ”¹ Section 2.4 â€” Dance Genre Recognition

Finally, the predicted motion vectors from all body parts are concatenated and fed into a separate LSTM for genre classification.

- **Input**:

$$
\left\{ \left\{ \hat{y}_t^e \right\}_{t=0}^{T-1} \right\}_{e \in E}
$$

- **Output**: Final genre prediction from last LSTM hidden state

$$
\hat{g} = \text{Softmax}(W h_T + b)
$$

- **Loss Function**:

$$
L_{\text{genre}} = -\sum_{k=1}^K g_k \log(\hat{g}_k)
$$

This fusion stage captures the global movement semantics needed to infer the genre label from distributed joint dynamics.

## âœ… Key Takeaways

- The **3D pose lifting** component is fully unsupervised and relies on temporal smoothness, reprojection, and pose consistency.
- **Motion recognition** is handled separately per body part using LSTM-based sequence models.
- **Dance genre classification** is conducted by aggregating part-level motions into a high-level spatiotemporal representation.

## ðŸ’­ Reflections

This section offers a technically elegant solution to an otherwise annotation-heavy problem.  
By leveraging weak priors and smoothness constraints, the method produces coherent 3D pose sequences from 2D data.  
Iâ€™m particularly impressed by the modularity â€” each phase (pose, motion, genre) is independently optimized but integrally linked.  
I plan to examine the 3D lifting in more detail later and possibly attempt a lightweight re-implementation using custom dance clips.
