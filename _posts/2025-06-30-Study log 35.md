🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-06-30]**  
Today’s work centered on two fronts: pushing SCU_Competition to new heights through classic feature optimization and restructuring my GitHub Pages to enhance portfolio visibility and navigation.

## 📊 SCU_Competition — Submission 31–33

**Focus**: Maximizing AUC with simpler, classic structures + filtered feature interactions  
**Model**: `Optuna-tuned LGBMClassifier` + StratifiedKFold CV + EarlyStopping  

**Strategies Applied**:
- Submission 31: Strategic feature selection + Optuna + interaction terms → **Kaggle AUC 0.8935**
- Submission 32: More refined Optuna tuning with extended trials → **Kaggle AUC 0.8861**
- Submission 33: CV-based tuning + conservative EarlyStopping → **Kaggle AUC 0.8808**

**Key Observations**:
- Submission 31 proved that classic + clean interaction features are still top-tier  
- Submission 32 reached the highest local AUC (0.9057) but saw slight generalization drop  
- Submission 33 provided a safer tuning route, avoiding overfitting via tighter validation

✅ **Takeaways**  
- Conservative modeling remains strong when paired with selective feature engineering  
- EarlyStopping helps regularize even aggressive Optuna-based trials  
- Interaction features must be filtered for actual impact, not just volume

## 🛠 GitHub Pages Restructuring

**Goal**: Improve readability and navigation of my portfolio blog  
**Actions Taken**:
- Refined category and folder structure (`/paper_review`, `/projects`, `/study_log`)  
- Added visual spacing, layout clarity, and more intuitive headings  
- Fixed post redundancy and performed manual syncing with local git repo

**Outcome**:
- Blog now serves as a cleaner, more organized public-facing tech portfolio  
- Easier navigation for professors, recruiters, or collaborators

## 🎯 Next Steps

- Submission 34: Combine clean modeling with SHAP-based filtering  
- Integrate auto feature selectors (e.g., Boruta, RFECV) into baseline  
- Add permanent sidebar or tag system in blog for quicker topic access

---

## ✅ TL;DR

📍 **SCU**: Classic + smart feature combos still outperform complex stacks  
📍 **Optuna**: More trials ≠ better Kaggle results — balance needed  
📍 **GitHub**: Clean portfolio blog is now easier to browse and share
