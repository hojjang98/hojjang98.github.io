🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-09-18]**  
Explored body-type matched exercise idea, reviewed reverse process in diffusion models, and advanced variable engineering & crisis labeling in the Big Contest 2025 project.  

---

## 💡 Idea  
- Proposed a new fitness idea: **[Body-Match Exercise](https://github.com/hojjang98/ideas/blob/main/fitness/body_match.md)**  
- Concept: Different body types may have exercises that **fit better** or feel more natural.  
- Goal: Explore matching frameworks between **body composition** and **exercise types**.  

---

## 📖 Paper Study  
- Continued study of **Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)**.  
- **Day 3 – Reverse Process (Denoising)**  
  - Focused on modeling the **reverse probability distribution**.  
  - Learned how a neural network approximates the **intractable reverse step** by predicting noise.  
  - Training reduces to a **simple MSE objective**, making diffusion models stable and effective.

## 🏆 Competition – Big Contest 2025  
- Progressed into **Week 2 (Variable Engineering & Crisis Definition)**.  
- Tasks completed:  
  - Designed **time-series derived features** (lags, moving averages, growth rates).  
  - Defined and labeled **crisis stages** (normal, risk, closure).  
  - Added **demographic and commercial area features**.  
  - Finalized dataset structure for next week’s modeling phase.

## ✅ TL;DR  
📍 New fitness idea: body-type & exercise matching  
📍 Studied reverse (denoising) process in DDPM  
📍 Engineered variables & defined crisis labels for Big Contest 2025 project
