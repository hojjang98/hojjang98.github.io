# ðŸ“¸ [2025-06-08] Real-Time Activity Recognizer â€” Final Wrap-up

After weeks of crawling, preprocessing, modeling, and fine-tuning, this marks the **final wrap-up** of the *Real-Time Daily Activity Recognizer* project.  
From simple grayscale CNNs to EfficientNetB0 with dropout and augmentation â€” this journey was a hands-on dive into the full image classification pipeline.

## ðŸ“š 1. What I Built

This project combined image crawling, model training, and webcam integration to simulate a real-world computer vision task.  
I handled everything from data collection to inference â€” using Keras, OpenCV, and transfer learning.

### ðŸ§± Technical Highlights
- Google Image crawler using `selenium` & `urllib`
- Image classification model using `EfficientNetB0` + `Dropout(0.5)`
- Real-time prediction via webcam (`cv2.VideoCapture`)
- Strong data augmentation using `ImageDataGenerator`
- Full training loop with callbacks: checkpointing, early stopping, LR scheduler
- Visualization with `matplotlib` (loss/accuracy curves, saved to `/figures`)

## ðŸ’¡ Reflections

- **Most important lesson**: Data quality matters more than model architecture.  
  â†’ Crawling images manually had too many noisy, irrelevant samples â€” next time I'll use **ImageNet**, **Kaggle datasets**, or **structured action datasets**.

- **Model-wise**, EfficientNetB0 + dropout gave the best trade-off between training speed and generalization.  
- **Technically**, integrating OpenCV inference was super fun â€” it gave an actual feeling of "real-time AI".

- I'm proud to have taken this from concept â†’ dataset â†’ model â†’ live prediction.

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Thoughts

This was never meant to be production-grade â€” but it **taught me the entire pipeline**.  
From crawling to inference, from augmentation to callbacks, I got to see where things break and how to improve them.

Now it's time to move on to new projects, with better data and deeper models.
