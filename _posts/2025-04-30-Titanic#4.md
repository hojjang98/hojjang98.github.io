Today was all about taking the **Titanic Survival Prediction** project to the next level through model experimentation and tuning ⚙️🚀

---

## 🔍 What I accomplished today

1. Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models:
   - **VotingClassifier** (soft voting) with RandomForest, GradientBoosting, XGBoost  
   - **StackingClassifier** using LogisticRegression as meta model  
   - **CatBoostClassifier** single model  
2. Performed hyperparameter tuning with:
   - `GridSearchCV` for individual models  
   - `Optuna` for RandomForestClassifier
3. Compared all submissions on both local validation and Kaggle leaderboard  
4. Translated modeling notebook to English for GitHub publication  
5. Generated and updated **submission logs** for all experiments

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

> **Iterating across different models and tuning strategies is critical.**  
> Sometimes the best local model doesn't win on the leaderboard — always validate broadly and log everything!

## 📈 Submission Summary

| Version | Model                              | Val Acc | Kaggle | Notes               |
|---------|-------------------------------------|---------|--------|---------------------|
| v1      | Soft Voting (RF + GB + XGB)         | 0.8090  | 0.7775 | Baseline Ensemble   |
| v2      | Stacking (→ LogisticRegression)     | 0.8034  | 0.7751 | Meta Model          |
| v3      | CatBoostClassifier (single)         | 0.7753  | 0.7631 |                     |
| v4      | GridSearchCV + VotingClassifier     | 0.7921  | 0.7799 | 🥇 Best Kaggle Score |
| v5      | Optuna-tuned RandomForestClassifier | 0.8146  | 0.7751 | Best Local Accuracy |

## 🧩 Next Steps

- Try Optuna tuning for other models (e.g., XGBoost, GB)
- Experiment with feature selection and SHAP analysis
- Build final model pipeline and prep for full documentation

> Data science isn’t about one perfect model — it’s about learning through every iteration 🧠  
> On to the next breakthrough tomorrow 💪
