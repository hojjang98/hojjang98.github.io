🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-07-25]**  
A multi-threaded day of ideation, modeling, implementation, and reading.  
Progressing steadily toward motion feedback systems and competition optimization.

## 💡 Project Idea — *Sweat Forecast: Predicting Pit Stain Risk by Hour*

Proposed a lighthearted but data-driven idea to predict underarm sweat visibility based on weather, clothing, and user activity.

### Key Points:
- Binary classifier for "Is it safe to wear gray?"
- Use weather, clothing color, activity level as features
- Visualize hourly risk via heatmaps
- Future app/web interface for "pit stain risk" alerts
- Strong use case in summer fashion decisions

---

## 📝 TOEIC Practice

Studied:
- Listening Part 3  
- Reading comprehension

Keeping consistent progress in test prep.

## 🍓 Team — *Smart Farm Strawberry Competition*

Participated in team meeting to discuss concept refinement.  
Reviewed key components for smart farming applications.

---

## 🕺 Personal Project — *PoseSyncEvaluator: 2D Pose-Based Dance Feedback*

Wrapped up initial implementation for pose-based motion comparison system.  
Successfully tested locally in VS Code after running feature extraction on Colab.

### Highlights:
- Used MediaPipe for 2D keypoint extraction  
- DTW + cosine similarity for alignment and scoring  
- Streamlit interface launched on local machine  
- All frame `.npy` data downloaded from Colab and configured properly

This marks the first real deployment of a full feedback pipeline using pose data.

## 📄 Paper Review — *Explainable Quality Assessment for Martial Arts*

✅ Day 2 – Literature & Method Review

Focused on methods for aligned motion scoring:

- Covered pose input types and evaluation paradigms  
- Explored Procrustes + DTW alignment  
- Reviewed ensemble regression techniques  
- SHAP used for joint-level interpretability  
- Noted that alignment quality is more crucial than model complexity

Planned next step: implement 2D version of skeleton angle extraction + scoring.

## 🏆 Competition — *Electricity Usage Forecasting* (DACON)

Ran 3 submissions today with various tuning strategies:

| No. | Description                                       | SMAPE         |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| 13  | Voting Ensemble + Full Feature Expansion          | **12.38430**  |
| 14  | XGBoost + SelectFromModel Feature Selection       | **11.65735**  |
| 15  | XGBoost + Literature-Inspired Features            | **11.73231**  |

### Next Plan:
- Try SelectFromModel + LightGBM  
- Explore Stacking Ensemble w/ top features  
- Segment models by building type  
- Add lag-based temporal features
