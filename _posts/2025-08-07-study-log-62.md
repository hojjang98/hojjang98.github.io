🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-08-07]**  
Pushed forward on multiple tracks today — from idea generation to paper implementation, and competition experiments. Solid momentum across the board.

---

## 💡 Idea Generation — *Visual Body Tracker*

Proposed a computer vision–based feedback system that tracks physical changes (e.g., back width, chest shape, shoulder gains) using pose estimation and visual analytics.  
This idea explores how fitness progress can be made **visually measurable**, not just by weight or subjective feelings.

## 📘 TOEIC Preparation

Continued studying for the TOEIC exam.  
Almost done with the full course — feeling confident and more prepared!

---

## 🏆 Competition — *Electricity Forecasting*

### 28. Baseline Feature-Only Model  
Tested the existing segmented Voting ensemble (`Time × Building Type`) with **all engineered features removed**.  
Goal was to benchmark the performance using only raw features.

- **Local SMAPE**: 11.9575  
- **Dacon SMAPE**: 15.4064  

### 29. Cluster-Based Feature Augmentation  
Used the `best_model` structure and introduced **clustering-based features** on top of engineered ones.  
Maintained VotingRegressor for final prediction.

## 📖 Paper Review — *DoWhy Implementation*

Studied how the DoWhy framework is used in practice by running actual implementation using the paper's dataset.  
This hands-on study helped bridge theory and application.

## 🎧 Personal Project — *Bass Seeker*

Advanced work on the **bass_seeker** audio analysis system.  
Still in early stages, but the core modules are in place. Further tuning and feature additions planned.

## 📚 Research Reading — *Taekwondo Evaluation Systems*

Read multiple papers on pose-based action quality assessment in Taekwondo.  
This was part of a broader literature review for novelty identification and future positioning.
