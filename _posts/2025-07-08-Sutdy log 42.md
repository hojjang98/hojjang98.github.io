🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-07-08]**  
Still feeling a bit off, so I kept the pace moderate. Continued tracking SCU_Competition progress, studied TOEIC listening and grammar patterns, and started rebuilding messy Chapter 1 code from *Deep Learning for Vision Systems*. Didn’t get to start the new CV project yet — planning to tackle that tomorrow alongside a proper paper review.

## 📊 SCU_Competition — Submission Review & Next Steps

**Focus**: Reviewed past results and prepared new experiment plans  
- No new submission today — mainly log cleanup and feature weight planning  
- Still holding Submission 61 as the current best (Kaggle AUC **0.8977**)  
- Considering a new single LGBM model with interaction-rich features  
- Might revisit a well-tuned StackingClassifier with `passthrough=True`  

**Reflection**:  
- VotingClassifier (6:2:2) seems like the sweet spot  
- Time to challenge it with a lightweight yet well-engineered solo model

## 🎧 TOEIC Study — Listening & Grammar Practice

**Listening (Unit 3 - Short Conversations)**:  
- Worked on recognizing paraphrases and intonation traps  
- Practiced speed listening and picking up key wh-words  

**Grammar (Adverbs vs. Adjectives)**:  
- Focused on commonly confused pairs like:  
  - *hard vs. hardly*  
  - *late vs. lately*  
  - *high vs. highly*  

**Reflection**:  
- Listening comprehension slowly improving  
- Grammar drills help solidify test instincts — daily practice is key

## 👁️ CV Study — Cleaning Up DL4VS Code

**Task**:  
- Rebuilding Chapter 1 notebook from scratch  
- Added intuitive examples: image loading, blurring, Sobel/Canny filters  

**Motivation**:  
- Original code was messy and hard to follow  
- Rewriting everything clearly with my own annotations  

**Reflection**:  
- Haven’t started the segmentation project yet, but the groundwork is solid  
- With cleaner code, jumping into experiments will be smoother tomorrow

## 🔍 Tomorrow’s Plan

- ✅ Launch segmentation project (start with baseline model)  
- ✅ Write Paper Review: EfficientNet (Day 4), summarize Days 1–3  
- ✅ Continue TOEIC prep (Part 3 Listening + Advanced Grammar)

## ✅ TL;DR

📍 **SCU**: No new submission — planning cleaner solo LGBM with strong feature interactions  
📍 **TOEIC**: Focused on short conversations + confusing grammar pairs  
📍 **CV**: Refactoring DL4VS Chapter 1 notebook for clarity  
📍 **Tomorrow**: Start CV project + resume paper review routine
