🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-08-27]**  
Advanced the *Habit Time Capsule* project from idea stage to an actual working prototype, while continuing TOEIC preparation with the exam scheduled this Sunday.

---

## 💡 Idea Generation — *Habit Time Capsule*  
Documented the concept in the [ideas repository](https://github.com/hojjang98/ideas/blob/main/self-insight/habit_time_capsule.md).  
- Inspired by *Atomic Habits*, the idea was to create a system where daily habit logs can simulate and visualize a “future self.”  
- Core features outlined: habit logging, trend visualization, forecasting, and a time capsule message function.

---

## 🛠️ Implementation — *Habit Time Capsule App*  
Built the prototype in the [Misc-Projects repository](https://github.com/hojjang98/Misc-Projects/tree/main/habit_time_capsule).  
- Developed with **Streamlit + SQLite** as a lightweight MVP.  
- Implemented:
  - Habit logging form  
  - Data viewing & trend visualization (matplotlib)  
  - Simple forecasting using moving averages  
  - Time capsule message saving to local storage  
- Learned how to connect Python’s `sqlite3` with Streamlit for interactive apps.

---

## 📘 TOEIC Preparation  
The TOEIC exam is on **August 31**.  
- Studied listening and reading intensively.  
- Practiced under timed conditions to simulate the real test.  
- Focused review on weaker sections identified earlier.
