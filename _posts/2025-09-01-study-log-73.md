🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-09-02]**  
Shared the finalized **12-week roadmap** and discussed **novelty directions** with teammates for our research project. The plan now has clear weekly milestones and a consolidated novelty statement.

---

## 📅 Research Roadmap  
- Established a **12-week timeline** covering dataset design, metric development, baseline modeling, human feedback integration, explainability, personalization, RL-based coaching, and final paper preparation.  
- Weekly outputs range from **skeleton extraction prototypes** to **RL-based feedback systems** and ultimately the **draft manuscript**.  

---

## ✨ Novelty Directions  
1. **New Metrics for Untouched Movements**  
   - Define evaluation criteria for movements like the *arm wave* where no formal scoring system exists.  
2. **Quantitative Scoring & Explainability**  
   - Propose metrics such as *Wave Propagation Index* and *Smoothness Score*, while making results interpretable (e.g., “Elbow angle changes were discontinuous”).  
3. **RL-based Feedback System**  
   - Move beyond one-shot evaluation by introducing **reinforcement learning with human-in-the-loop feedback** for iterative skill improvement.  
4. **Original Dataset Creation**  
   - Build a novel dataset with self-recorded movements, providing an independent contribution at the undergraduate level.  
5. **Personalized Evaluation**  
   - Track individual improvement rather than relying only on absolute scores, enhancing real-world applicability.

## 📑 Finalized Contribution Statement (Draft)  
This research proposes **new evaluation metrics and quantitative scoring methods** for movements previously lacking formal criteria (e.g., *arm wave*).  
Using a **self-constructed dataset**, we validate a **reinforcement learning–based feedback system** to enable iterative improvement.  
Furthermore, we emphasize **personalized evaluation and explainability**, extending the scope of action assessment from simple classification to **practical coaching and real-world application**.
