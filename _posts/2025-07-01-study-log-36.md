🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-07-01]**  
Today was a well-balanced study day across three key areas: competition experimentation, hands-on GAN practice, and my very first formal paper review!

## 📊 SCU_Competition — Submission 36–40

**Focus**: Comparing model types under fixed feature structure  
**Goal**: Find the sweet spot between simplicity and generalization

**Highlights**:
- Submission 36: Full feature set + plain LGBM (no tuning) → CV AUC 0.8724 / Kaggle AUC 0.8892
- Submission 37: Tuned LGBM (simple structure) → **Kaggle AUC 0.8932**
- Submission 38: Switched to RandomForest → noticeable drop (**AUC 0.8805**)
- Submission 39: LogisticRegression baseline → consistent but limited (**AUC 0.8736**)
- Submission 40: LGBM + RandomSearchCV → robust tuning (**AUC 0.8915**)

**Takeaways**:
- Simple LGBM still outperforms both ensemble trees and linear models in this task  
- Feature structure is stable; now tuning is the key lever  
- RandomSearchCV with constraints yields solid results without overfitting

## 🧠 Computer Vision Self-Study — GAN Playground

**What I Did**:
- Played with a basic GAN model using PyTorch  
- Generated simple synthetic digits (MNIST-style)  
- Adjusted generator/discriminator learning rates and batch sizes  

**Insights**:
- Watching generator loss collapse is oddly satisfying  
- Even basic GANs teach a lot about optimization dynamics  
- Planning to explore conditional GANs next

## 📄 Paper Review Kickoff — MobileNetV2

**Started**: [MobileNetV2: Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381)  
**Today’s Focus**: Day 1 – Abstract, Introduction, Problem Statement  
**Repo**: [Paper Review – GitHub](https://github.com/hojjang98/Paper-Review/blob/main/vision/01_mobilenetv2/summary.md)

**Reflection**:
- Really enjoyed this first deep-dive  
- Realized the importance of mobile constraints in architecture design  
- Looking forward to dissecting the inverted residual block tomorrow

## 🎯 Next Steps

- CV: Try conditional GAN with labels  
- SCU: Add SHAP filtering to next submission  
- Paper Review: Sketch MobileNetV2 architecture + start Section 3 analysis  
- Blog: Consider auto-generated paper index page by category/tag

## ✅ TL;DR

📍 **SCU**: Simple LGBM wins again — balance is better than brute force  
📍 **CV**: GANs are super fun and super sensitive to tuning  
📍 **Paper**: Started MobileNetV2 review, great kickoff to the reading habit
