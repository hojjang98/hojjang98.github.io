## 💡 Project Idea — *Taste by Color: Visual Food Flavor Predictor*

Proposed a fun computer vision system that predicts **flavor profiles (sweet, spicy, sour, etc.)** based on **food image color features**.  

Inspired by human heuristics like:  
> "Red-orange = spicy?" "Light brown = sweet?"  

Core concept:
- Use dominant HSV color features
- Train a classifier to predict taste labels
- Possibly use recipes or crowdsourced labels for supervision

## 🧪 Competition — *Electricity Usage Forecasting* (DACON)

### 22. Time × Building Type Voting Ensemble  

Split data by:
- **Time**: Night / Day / Evening  
- **Building Type**: Top 7 + Others  

For each of the resulting 24 subgroups, trained a **VotingRegressor (XGB + LGBM + GBR)**.  
Also introduced new feature combinations:
- `hour_sin`, `hour_cos` (cyclical time features)  
- `냉방_x_시간`, `면적_x_요일` (crossed variables)

📊 **Results**  
- Local SMAPE: **11.7492**  
- Public LB: **9.61451** ✅ *Best score so far*

## ✅ TL;DR  

📍 **Idea**: *Taste-by-Color* — food image → flavor profile classifier  
📍 **Competition**: Best-performing Voting Ensemble using Time × Building segmentation (SMAPE: **9.6145**)
