Today I made major progress in my **Titanic Survival Prediction** project 🚀  
I completed **full feature engineering** and finalized the EDA notebook.

---

## 🔍 What I accomplished today

1. Finished EDA and cleaned the data  
2. Created new features through feature engineering:
   - Extracted `Title` from the `Name`
   - Grouped rare titles together (e.g., Lady, Countess → Rare)
   - Calculated `FamilySize` by adding `SibSp` and `Parch`
   - Created `IsAlone` feature for passengers traveling alone
   - Binned `Age` into 5 groups (`AgeBand`)
   - Binned `Fare` into 4 groups (`FareBand`)
   - Converted `Embarked` into one-hot encoded variables
   - Created `Has_Cabin` feature based on missing cabin information
3. Dropped unnecessary columns (`PassengerId`, `Name`, `Ticket`) to prepare for modeling
4. Updated README.md with a link to the finalized EDA notebook

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

> **Feature engineering is not just about adding more variables — it's about making the information in your data more useful for the model.**  
> Today’s transformations laid a strong foundation for building better predictive models.

## 🧩 Next Steps

- Start building baseline machine learning models
  - Try Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.
- Compare model performances
- Prepare for Kaggle submissions
