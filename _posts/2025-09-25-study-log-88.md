🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-09-23]**  
Submitted an assignment, explored a new healthcare idea, studied the **Vision Transformer** paper (Day 1), and advanced the dance-beat alignment pipeline.  

---

## 📄 Assignment Submission  
- Submitted a **business plan project**.  
- Fortunately, the assignment included an “idea” section → reused one of the prepared ideas.  

---

## 💡 Idea  
- Proposed **[Smoke-Free Journey](https://github.com/hojjang98/ideas/blob/main/healthcare/smoke_free_journey.md)**.  
- Concept: Enhance smoking cessation by embedding supportive interventions into daily travel routines.

## 📖 Paper Study – Vision Transformer (ViT)  
- **Paper**: *An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale* (ICLR 2021)  
- **Day 1 – Abstract & Introduction (Summary)**  
  - CNNs have dominated CV for a decade but suffer from strong inductive biases and limited scalability.  
  - Transformers in NLP scale efficiently and achieve state-of-the-art results.  
  - **Core question**: Can the same Transformer be applied directly to vision, without convolutions?  
  - **Core idea**: Treat an image as a sequence of flattened patches, feed them into a standard Transformer with a [CLS] token and positional embeddings.  
  - **Contributions**:  
    1. Introduced **Vision Transformer (ViT)**, the first pure Transformer for large-scale vision.  
    2. Showed ViT rivals or surpasses CNNs when trained on huge datasets (e.g., JFT-300M).  
    3. Confirmed that scaling laws from NLP also apply in vision.

## 🎬 Paper Study – Dance Beat Alignment  
- Built and tested a **skeleton + beat alignment pipeline**.  
- **Methods implemented**:  
  - Extracted skeletons from both real and generated videos using MediaPipe Pose.  
  - Used librosa to detect tempo/beat times → overlayed on skeleton trajectories.  
  - Implemented BPM sweep (50–150 BPM) → generated error curves → identified optimal BPM (minimum error point).  
  - Defined alignment score based on mean/std error.  
  - Validated metric by comparing original vs tempo-shifted music (128 BPM).  

- **Progress Today**:  
  - Pipeline fully established (skeleton extraction + beat overlay + BPM sweep).  
  - Error metric defined and partially validated.  

- **Next Steps**:  
  - Apply BPM sweep to multiple generated dance videos.  
  - Compare “on-beat” vs “off-beat” generated videos directly.  
  - Scale up to ~100 generated videos for benchmark construction.
