🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-08-13]**  
Focused on competition model refinement and documented a new urban safety project idea.  
Achieved the **best public LB score to date** in the electricity forecasting competition.

---

## 💡 Idea Generation — *Urban Flood Shield*  
Outlined a concept for an **AI-powered urban flood prediction and mitigation system** to minimize damage from sudden heavy rainfall.  
The system would integrate real-time weather data, urban drainage capacity, and risk mapping to provide early warnings and optimize city responses.

## 🏆 Competition — *Electricity Forecasting*  
Conducted experiments with building-type–specific XGBoost modeling:  

| No. | Description | Local SMAPE | Public LB SMAPE |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| 34  | Reduced overfitting by adjusting parameters: `eta`, `subsample`, `colsample_bytree`, `min_child_weight`, `gamma`, `reg_alpha`, `reg_lambda`. | 4.618441972505276 | **7.3385022051** |
| 35  | Split data by building type, optimized **XGBoost hyperparameters** via `RandomizedSearchCV`, applied **7-Fold OOF CV**, then fixed once for stable performance evaluation. | 4.057732 | 7.3767868422 |

**Best Score:** 🏆 **7.3385022051** (Experiment 34, Public LB)

## ✅ TL;DR  
📍 **Urban Flood Shield**: Concept for AI-driven flood prediction and prevention  
📍 Refined XGBoost parameters to reduce overfitting → **best public LB score achieved**  
📍 Applied RandomizedSearchCV + OOF CV for stable building-type–specific model performance
