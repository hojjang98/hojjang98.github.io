title: "🚢 Titanic Project Kickoff – First EDA Exploration"
date: 2025-04-26
---

Today I officially kicked off my **Titanic Survival Prediction** project 🚀  
As the first step, I focused on **getting familiar with the data** through basic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).

---

## 🔍 What I explored today

1. Loaded the `train` and `test` datasets  
2. Inspected data structures (`head()`, `info()`, `describe(include='all')`)  
3. Checked for missing values and noted columns needing attention (`Age`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`, `Fare`)  
4. Visualized key features:
   - **Survival distribution** (`Survived`)
   - **Gender vs. Survival rate** (`Sex`)
   - **Passenger Class vs. Survival rate** (`Pclass`)
5. Set the initial roadmap for data cleaning:
   - Fill or drop missing values appropriately
   - Engineer new features if necessary (e.g., family size, title extraction)

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

> **Good EDA is about asking: "How will this help the model later?"**  
> Rather than aimlessly plotting graphs, I tried to focus on features that might actually impact survival outcomes.

---

## 🧩 Next Steps

- Handle missing values carefully (especially `Age`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`, and `Fare`)  
- Explore feature engineering opportunities (e.g., extracting titles from names, family-related features)  
- Start simple baseline modeling to establish reference performance
