🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-07-16]**  
Today was a well-balanced study day across multiple focus areas — SQL, paper review prep, and portfolio maintenance.

---

## 📊 Personal Project — GitHub & Blog Refactoring

**Focus**: Repository structure & portfolio polishing  
**Goal**: Make all public assets more consistent, professional, and showcase-ready  

**Highlights**:

- Reviewed inconsistencies across GitHub repos (naming, folder hierarchy, readme formatting)
- Planned July goal: complete full refactoring by end of month
- Blog transformation idea: transition current blog into clean, official portfolio

**Takeaways**:

- Consistency across projects makes a huge difference in presentation
- Markdown templating saves time (reusable blocks for reviews/logs)
- Blog design will eventually reflect my academic/professional identity

## 🧠 SQL Study — Conditional Expressions & Null Handling

**What I Did**:

- Practiced writing SQL queries by hand
- Focused on conditional functions and NULL-related handling
- Solved several exercises to reinforce syntax and use cases

**Insights**:

- `NULLIF` is useful to avoid division-by-zero errors  
- `NVL` (or COALESCE) is critical for replacing missing values with defaults  
- Writing by hand + solving problems solidifies understanding much better than passive review

## 📄 Paper Review — *Action Recognition using Pose Estimation*

**Preparation Status**:

- Organized notes and outlined what to review first  
- Skimmed the abstract, methods, and dataset section  
- Plan to formally start the summary and implementation tomorrow

**Next Focus**:

- Summarize key sections (architecture, dataset, training setup)  
- Begin lightweight reimplementation and visualization prep  
- Decide how to structure experiment logs and diagrams

## 🧠 Research Planning — Dance Study Direction

**What I Did**:

- Expanded on what to discuss at next study session:  
  - Topic feasibility  
  - Evaluation methods  
  - Extension plans (genre classification → motion similarity)  
- Reorganized shared documents and brainstormed new datasets or open-source tools

**Insights**:

- Keeping the topic lightweight helps with reproducibility and iteration
- There’s high interest in real-world datasets and visual interpretability
- Might need to draft a mini proposal for clearer direction

## 🌟 Next Steps

* Tidy up GitHub notebooks & README styles (uniform format)
* Push SQL note snippets to personal wiki repo
* Kick off paper review post + experiments tomorrow

---

## ✅ TL;DR

📍 **Project**: GitHub/blog refactoring underway — aiming for July completion  
📍 **Study**: Practiced SQL conditionals + NULL handling (`NULLIF`, `NVL`)  
📍 **Paper**: Organized notes and will begin formal summary tomorrow
