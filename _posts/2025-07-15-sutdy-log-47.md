🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-07-14]**  
Another productive day — wrapped up key topics across TOEIC prep, CV experimentation, paper study, and research planning.  
Finalized second phase of the EfficientNet paper review and pushed forward with model scaling experiments.

## 📘 TOEIC Study — RC Focus & Vocabulary Expansion

**Focus**:  
- Practiced **Reading Comprehension** with a focus on **inference-based questions**  
- Studied advanced vocabulary and **contextual usage** in long-form passages

**Reflection**:  
- Improving speed and accuracy in passages with implicit reasoning  
- High-level vocabulary retention through contextual immersion

## 🧪 Research Planning — Paper Study Bot Idea

**Focus**:  
- Brainstormed a lightweight **GPT-based paper review assistant**  
- Goal: internal use within the study group to **summarize, comment, and track paper progress**

**Reflection**:  
- Tool could streamline group study and future publication planning  
- Will scope out MVP features (summarization, annotation, retrieval) over the next few weeks

## 🧠 Paper Study — EfficientNet (Day 4 & 5)

**Focus**:  
- Completed **Section 4.3** and **Table 2 analysis**  
- Wrapped up performance comparison across EfficientNet-B1 to B7  
- Reviewed **ablation studies**, **scaling methods**, and performance trade-offs

**Reflection**:  
- Compound scaling consistently outperforms naive scaling strategies  
- Final summary coming up — will consolidate all notes into GitHub post soon

## 🧪 CV Experiment — EfficientNet Scaling Models (CIFAR-10)

**Focus**:  
- Running comparative experiments on four scaling variants:
  - ✅ Base model  
  - ✅ **Depth-only** scaled model  
  - ✅ **Width-only** scaled model  
  - ✅ **Resolution-only** scaled model  
  - ✅ **Compound-scaled** model

**Status**:  
- 🚧 Training still in progress — full results pending  
- Metrics being logged: **FLOPs**, **parameters**, **validation/test accuracy**  
- Summary table and plots will be generated post-training

**Reflection**:  
- Expecting compound scaling to strike the best performance-efficiency trade-off  
- Preliminary trends look promising — more insights to come after full runs
