🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-08-11]**  
A well-rounded day spanning idea generation, SQL learning, competition modeling, project iteration, and deep dives into research papers and novel RL-based evaluation concepts.

---

## 💡 Idea Generation — *Mind Scope*
Documented the concept for a **self-insight + mindfulness tool** that combines cognitive state tracking with guided meditation.  
The goal is to help users identify recurring worry patterns and address them with real-time mindfulness prompts.

---

## 📘 SQL Study
Focused on **multi-row functions** and their applications in data aggregation and group-level analysis.

---

## 🏆 Competition — *Electricity Forecasting*
Currently running an **Optuna-tuned ensemble** experiment:  
- Segmented by `Time (Night/Day/Evening) × Building Type`  
- Models: XGB, LGBM, GBR  
- Tuning both **hyperparameters** and **Voting weights**  
- Engineered features refined from **Private_3rd** version  
⚠️ Results pending due to extended training time.

---

## 🎧 Personal Project — *Bass Seeker*
Completed the **bass_seeker** prototype, but initial results didn’t meet expectations.  
Considering adjustments to feature extraction and similarity weighting for better alignment with project goals.

## 📖 Paper Review — *Few-Shot Grounding DINO for Agriculture*
Reviewed and documented the **Few-Shot Grounding DINO** adaptation for agricultural object detection.  
Analyzed how BERT embeddings were modified for class-specific understanding with minimal data.

## 📚 Paper Study — *Arm Wave Quality Evaluation (RL-based)*
Outlined a novel RL-driven framework for **arm wave performance scoring**:
- **Goal**: Classify wave quality (good/bad) and score (0–100)
- **Two-model RL architecture**:
  - **Reward Model (RM)**: Human preference–based pairwise loss
  - **Value Model**: Offline RL for stable absolute scoring
- Combines **pose-based physical metrics** (amplitude, smoothness, phase consistency) with **learned embeddings**
- Generates **frame-level quality heatmaps** and **segment feedback**
- Metrics and scoring designed to be **model-agnostic and reusable**

**Pipeline**:
1. Pose extraction (MediaPipe/BlazePose, 33 keypoints)
2. Normalization & DTW standardization
3. Feature generation (physics-based + learned embeddings)
4. RM → Frame/segment rewards  
5. Value Model → Final score (0–100)  
6. Feedback generation (“phase lag instability”, “jerk spikes”, etc.)

**Planned Next Steps**:
- Define & formalize 3–4 wave-specific metrics  
- Build labeling UI for preference pairs  
- Week 1 MVP: data pipeline, RM prototype, basic scoring & visualization
