Although I haven’t committed to any GitHub updates or hands-on coding today, I’ve been deep in coursework — and that counts too!  

I completed **two full classes** today and have been focusing intently on my current **machine learning assignment**, which revolves around ensemble techniques.  
It’s been an eye-opener.

## 🧠 Ensemble Learning – More Than Just Voting

Lately, I’ve been gaining a clearer intuition about how ensemble methods like bagging, boosting, and stacking truly work — not just in theory, but in *practice*.  
It’s not just about combining models; it’s about understanding how and why they complement each other.

I keep wondering:  
> *“Which types of datasets would really benefit from this?”*  
It’s sparked a curiosity to revisit past projects or even explore Kaggle datasets with these techniques in mind.

## 🛑 Reality Check

Unfortunately, next week will be packed:  
- Monday–Tuesday: Sokcho trip 🌊  
- Wednesday–Friday: Reserve forces training (예비군... yay?)  

So, realistically, I won’t be getting much done in terms of projects or coding until the weekend.

## 💬 Final Thoughts

Even though I’m not pushing commits or building something flashy,  
this kind of “quiet progress” — wrestling with concepts, connecting the dots — is what keeps me moving forward.

Not every step needs to be visible. But every step still counts.
