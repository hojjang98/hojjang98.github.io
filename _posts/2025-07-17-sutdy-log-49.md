## 📊 Smoking Zone GIS Project — Legal Area Mapping

**Focus**: Building a GIS-based visualization of legal smoking zones in Seoul  
**Goal**: Provide a clear and interactive public resource that highlights *legally permitted* smoking areas, not just "self-declared" ones

**Highlights**:

* Finalized dataset acquisition from 서울 열린데이터 광장  
* Converted address data to lat/lon via geocoding  
* Built an interactive map using Folium (district-level overlays + individual markers)

## 🧠 TOEIC Study — Listening Practice

**What I Did**:

* Focused on Part 3/4 listening drills (workplace conversations + announcements)  
* Timed section practice (45 minutes) with error review

**Insights**:

* Getting more comfortable with fast dialogues  
* Distractors in questions are still tricky — need more focused review  
* Continue grammar review (especially verb tense traps)

## 💡 Idea Brainstorm — `fact_rank`

**What I Did**:

* Sketched out the idea of a **community-curated fact-checking platform**, focused on verifiability  
* Introduced a scoring mechanism via RLHF-like upvoting for "facts" vs. "claims"  
* Tentative project title: `fact_rank`

**Insights**:

* Core issue is moderation & incentive design  
* MVP could be academic reference-only fact aggregation  
* Possibly valuable for digital literacy education

## 📄 Paper Review — *Action Recognition Using Pose Estimation*

**Started**: [Action Recognition Using Pose Estimation (arXiv:2109.09166)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09166)  
**Today’s Focus**: High-level architecture and relevance to dance action classification  
**Repo**: _To be added after summary notebook completion_

**Reflection**:

* Uses OpenPose-based 2D keypoints + CNN (2D & 3D) for action recognition  
* Avoids using raw RGB input — fully pose-based, lightweight approach  
* Architecture is modular and well-suited for dance genre classification tasks  
* Paper structure and scope is very manageable for an undergrad-level replication

## 🔍 Research Club Planning — Feasibility Check

**What I Did**:

* Revisited our short paper idea feasibility for an undergrad team  
* Compared existing literature vs. expected technical stack  
* Evaluated team capability for data collection, modeling, and presentation

**Insights**:

* A simplified version (e.g., genre classification via BlazePose + CNN) is definitely feasible  
* Dataset creation is the key bottleneck — but solvable via filming or YouTube scraping  
* Paper writing likely viable within 1–2 months if scoped properly

## ✅ TL;DR

📍 **Project**: Smoking zones visualized at legal level — groundwork completed  
📍 **Study**: Steady TOEIC progress — listening speed improving  
📍 **Paper**: Pose-based action recognition is feasible and relevant for our dance project
