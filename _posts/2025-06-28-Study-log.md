🧠 Daily Study Log [2025-06-28]
Today was a blend of competition modeling, CV theory reinforcement, and long-term dataset preparation.
I mainly focused on feature engineering in a tabular campaign dataset, studied core cross-validation strategies, and continued data wrangling for a renewable energy forecasting competition.

📊 SCU_Competition — Final Optimization Phase
Focus: Maximizing AUC score on a marketing campaign acceptance prediction task

Model: LGBMClassifier with Optuna and RandomSearchCV tuning

Feature Strategy:

Carefully selected cluster-based features (from KMeans on income, spending, visits)

Simplified to top engineered features (purchase sum, wine ratio, web×campaign)

Ensemble Attempt:

Soft voting of top models (11, 9, 23)

Weighted voting (7:3 ratio) outperformed standard ensemble

✅ Takeaways

Found that over-complex stacking/SHAP filtering degraded generalization

Simpler + well-tuned models performed better, especially with clean features + clustering

🧪 CV Theory & Cross-Validation Review
Reviewed StratifiedKFold, GroupKFold, and TimeSeriesSplit

Ran multiple cross_val_score() tests with different seeds and splits

Analyzed gap between local CV AUC and Kaggle leaderboard AUC

✅ Reflections

Reinforced that Kaggle public set ≠ CV folds

CV is not about getting high score — it’s about stability and generalization

🔄 Data Collection — Renewable Energy Forecasting
Target: Predict energy generation per region and energy source

Data: 2019–2023 5-year monthly generation data from KEPCO and KPX

Work:

Combined multiple Excel sources into unified tables

Processed generation amount, capacity, and aging factors

Structured final format: (region, source, month) → generation

✅ Progress

Cleaned and merged over 30+ CSVs

Grouped by region and source for time-series modeling readiness

🎯 Next Steps
SCU_Competition:

Try meta-feature stacking from top model outputs

Build a KMeans cluster → acceptance rate encoding feature

CV Practice:

Try nested CV and review model selection pitfalls

Visualize score variance across folds

Forecasting Competition:

Add weather & calendar features

Test basic XGBRegressor time-series model

✅ TL;DR
📍 SCU: Cluster features + weighted voting boosted AUC
📍 CV: Refined understanding of validation strategy gaps
📍 Energy: Merged 5-year data — ready for modeling
