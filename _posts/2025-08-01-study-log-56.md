## 💡 Project Idea — *Sunburn Simulator*

Proposed a playful yet science-backed idea to estimate **sunburn risk** based on skin tone, UV index, and exposure time.

🔗 [View full idea](https://github.com/hojjang98/ideas/blob/main/fun/sunburn_simulator.md)

### Key Points:
- Input: skin type, UV index, time outdoors  
- Output: estimated time to sunburn  
- Practical use in skincare or outdoor planning  
- Potential for app with UV-based alert system

---

## 📝 TOEIC Practice

Studied:
- Listening: Part 3 dialogue comprehension  
- Reading: Passage interpretation and vocabulary review  

Keeping momentum in test prep with consistent focus.

## 🏆 Competition — *Electricity Usage Forecasting* (DACON)

Ran several submissions using different configurations of `VotingRegressor` combining XGBoost and LightGBM.

### Recent Experiments:
16. Basic Voting ensemble with XGBoost + LightGBM (equal weights)  
  → Local: 15.7148 | Public LB: 14.6649768819

17. Manually tuned weights (0.6 for XGBoost, 0.4 for LightGBM)  
  → Local: 15.6376 | Public LB: 14.6108526927

18. Auto-tuned weights using Optuna for the Voting ensemble  
  → Local: 15.5960 | Public LB: 14.5501608484  
   (best xgb_weight ≈ 0.71)

### Highlights:
- Extensive feature engineering: datetime, weather, and building-related variables  
- Applied `LabelEncoder` + `OneHotEncoder` to categorical building types  
- Voting ensemble trained and validated using hold-out from August  
- Tracking SMAPE on validation and public leaderboard

Next Steps:
- Segment models by building type  
- Experiment with lag-based temporal features  
- Try feature selection or add a third model (e.g., GBR) with weighted voting



## 📄 Paper Review — *Explainable Skeletal Assessment for Martial Arts*

✅ Finished Day 3 — Continued analysis of motion scoring and SHAP interpretation  
🔗 [View summary](https://github.com/hojjang98/Paper-Review/blob/main/vision/04_explainable_martial_arts_eval/summary.md)

### Key Takeaways:
- End-to-end: alignment → scoring → explainability  
- DTW + skeleton normalization central to scoring  
- SHAP used for joint-wise contribution interpretation  
- Planning to implement a 2D-based scoring prototype next

## 🔁 Project Transition

### ✅ *PoseSyncEvaluator*  
- Fully implemented and launched locally with Streamlit  
- All frame data handled and documented in GitHub

### 🚀 *bass_seeker*  
- New project initialized for sound/genre analysis  
🔗 [Repo Link](https://github.com/hojjang98/ML-Projects/tree/main/bass_seeker)

## 🤝 Research Club — *New Topic: Taekwondo Poomsae Evaluation*

Discussing a new theme for the research group — **pose-based evaluation of Taekwondo forms**.

### Related Papers:
- *Vision-Based Recognition of Taekwondo Poomsae Using Deep Learning*, IEEE Access, 2020  
- *Automatic Skill Evaluation in Martial Arts using 3D Pose Estimation*, CVPRW 2021  
- *Pose-based Action Recognition for Taekwondo Movements*, Sensors, 2022  
- *Deep Learning-Based Action Quality Assessment in Taekwondo*, Applied Sciences, 2023  

Focus: skeleton-based form alignment, scoring, and explainability.

## ✅ TL;DR

📍 **Idea**: Sunburn Simulator — UV + skin type → burn-time estimation  
📍 **TOEIC**: Listening Part 3 + Reading drills  
📍 **Competition**: VotingRegressor running (XGBoost + SVR)  
📍 **Paper**: SHAP + DTW scoring method reviewed  
📍 **Projects**: PoseSyncEvaluator done → bass_seeker started  
📍 **Study Group**: Brainstorming Taekwondo-based evaluation research
