🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-08-01]**  
A well-balanced day of idea generation, competition modeling, project transition, and academic reading.

## 💡 Project Idea — *Sunburn Simulator*

Proposed a playful yet science-backed idea to estimate **sunburn risk** based on skin tone, UV index, and exposure time.

🔗 [View full idea](https://github.com/hojjang98/ideas/blob/main/fun/sunburn_simulator.md)

### Key Points:
- Input: skin type, UV index, time outdoors  
- Output: estimated time to sunburn  
- Practical use in skincare or outdoor planning  
- Potential for app with UV-based alert system

## 📝 TOEIC Practice

Studied:
- Listening: Part 3 dialogue comprehension  
- Reading: Passage interpretation and vocabulary review  

Keeping momentum in test prep with consistent focus.

## 🏆 Competition — *Electricity Usage Forecasting* (DACON)

Ran the **3rd submission** today using a VotingRegressor combining XGBoost and SVR.  
The model takes a long time to train, so submission is pending.

### Highlights:
- Extensive feature engineering: datetime, weather, building info  
- Applied `LabelEncoder` + `OneHotEncoder` to building types  
- Ensemble model trained and validated  
- Monitoring SMAPE after submission

Sample code (core logic):

```python
ensemble = VotingRegressor(
    estimators=[('xgb', xgb), ('svr', svr)]
)
ensemble.fit(X_train, y_train)

val_pred = ensemble.predict(X_val)
val_smape = smape(y_val.values, val_pred)

print(
    f"✅ Validation SMAPE: {val_smape:.4f}"
)

```

Next Steps:
Try LightGBM with similar features for faster iteration

Segment models by building type

Explore lag-based temporal features



## 📄 Paper Review — *Explainable Skeletal Assessment for Martial Arts*

✅ Finished Day 3 — Continued analysis of motion scoring and SHAP interpretation  
🔗 [View summary](https://github.com/hojjang98/Paper-Review/blob/main/vision/04_explainable_martial_arts_eval/summary.md)

### Key Takeaways:
- End-to-end: alignment → scoring → explainability  
- DTW + skeleton normalization central to scoring  
- SHAP used for joint-wise contribution interpretation  
- Planning to implement a 2D-based scoring prototype next

## 🔁 Project Transition

### ✅ *PoseSyncEvaluator*  
- Fully implemented and launched locally with Streamlit  
- All frame data handled and documented in GitHub

### 🚀 *bass_seeker*  
- New project initialized for sound/genre analysis  
🔗 [Repo Link](https://github.com/hojjang98/ML-Projects/tree/main/bass_seeker)

## 🤝 Research Club — *New Topic: Taekwondo Poomsae Evaluation*

Discussing a new theme for the research group — **pose-based evaluation of Taekwondo forms**.

### Related Papers:
- *Vision-Based Recognition of Taekwondo Poomsae Using Deep Learning*, IEEE Access, 2020  
- *Automatic Skill Evaluation in Martial Arts using 3D Pose Estimation*, CVPRW 2021  
- *Pose-based Action Recognition for Taekwondo Movements*, Sensors, 2022  
- *Deep Learning-Based Action Quality Assessment in Taekwondo*, Applied Sciences, 2023  

Focus: skeleton-based form alignment, scoring, and explainability.
