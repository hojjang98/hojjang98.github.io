title: "📊 EDA Direction Locked In – Understanding Sales by District & Industry"
date: 2025-04-17
---

After digging through Seoul’s commercial sales data for a few days,  
I finally feel like today was the day I **nailed down the direction** of this project’s EDA.

Instead of aimlessly slicing data, I asked:  
> “If I want to predict how much a business can earn in a specific neighborhood, what do I *actually* need to understand?”

## 🔍 What I focused on today

1. Revisited the core goal:  
   → *“Estimate revenue based on district (`행정동`) and service type (`업종`).”*
2. Made sure all data processing aligns with this goal  
3. Grouped and sorted revenue by district + industry + quarter  
4. Identified potential gaps:  
   - Current data only shows **total revenue**, not **number of stores**  
   - Average per-store revenue isn’t available yet  
5. Realized that additional data (e.g. number of stores, population, foot traffic) will be crucial for modeling

## 🧠 Key Takeaway

> **EDA isn’t just about exploring — it’s about preparing your data to answer real questions.**  
> Today I stopped floating in "what’s interesting?" and locked in on "what’s *useful* for prediction?"

## 🧩 Next Steps

- Look for external datasets (e.g. store count per district, demographics, foot traffic)  
- Design the features that will feed into the regression model  
- Begin framing the problem as:  
  > *“If a 치킨집/카페/미용실 opens in X neighborhood, how much will it likely earn?”*

> Feels good to finally have a compass 🧭  
> Let’s move from exploration → modeling.
