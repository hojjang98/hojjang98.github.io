🧠 **Daily Study Log [2025-08-18]**  
Worked on a new idea project, practiced SQL exam problems, advanced competition experiments with blending stability, reviewed experiments & results in the few-shot adaptation paper, continued development of the Bass Seeker project, and structured the novelty pipeline for the arm wave quality assessment paper.

## 💡 Idea Generation — *Fit 2 Give*  
Proposed a concept combining **fitness tracking and charitable giving**, where calories burned or workout milestones trigger donations to social causes.  
The idea links personal health motivation with social contribution.

## 🏆 Competition — *Electricity Forecasting*  
Refined building-type–specific blending strategies to mitigate overfitting:

| No. | Description | Local SMAPE | Public LB SMAPE |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| 39  | Addressed overfitting: tuned XGB/LGBM via **RandomizedSearchCV** for each building type, applied **7-Fold OOF**, computed optimal weights per fold and averaged them, then retrained with 5 different seeds for **seed averaging**. *(best)* | 4.065438 | **7.0021252141** |
| 40  | Integrated flexible folds, negative prediction clipping, standardized LGBM params, adaptive weight shrinkage, and 5-seed averaging into a unified codebase. | 4.370971 | **7.0118167688** |
| 41  | Similar to 39, but blended fold-wise optimal weights using **trimmed mean + shrink** for conservative weighting, combined with 5-seed averaging. | — | — |

**Best Score:** 🏆 **7.0021252141** (Experiment 39, Public LB)

## 📄 Paper Study — *Few-Shot Grounding DINO for Agriculture (Day 3)*  
Reviewed **Experiments & Results**, focusing on how few-shot embedding adaptation compares to zero-shot and fully fine-tuned baselines.

- **Datasets:** Crop/weed detection, fruit counting, insect ID, wheat head detection, PhenoBench (agriculture); plus remote sensing datasets for validation.  
- **Baselines:** Zero-shot Grounding DINO, fully fine-tuned YOLO, and other SOTA models.  
- **Key Results:**  
  - Up to **+24% mAP over YOLO** on agriculture datasets.  
  - About **+10% improvement over SOTA** in remote sensing.  
  - Zero-shot works in simple scenes but fails in cluttered settings. Few-shot alleviates this.  
- **Effect of Shot Number:**  
  - 1-shot: sometimes worse than zero-shot (multi-class issues).  
  - 4-shot & 16-shot: steady performance gains.  
  - Instance segmentation: 8-shot showed strong improvements.  
- **Takeaway:** Few-shot adaptation offers large performance gains with minimal data, avoids prompt engineering, and generalizes well across domains.

## 💾 SQL Practice  
Continued solving **mock exam problems**, focusing on query optimization and multi-table joins.  
Maintaining steady progress toward the upcoming certification exam.

## 🎶 Personal Project — *Bass Seeker*  
Began implementing **bass_selector** (v0.4), handling YouTube metadata retrieval and optional audio downloads.  
Core features include:  
- Filtering candidates by **duration, title keywords, and recency**  
- Ranking by **views, recency, and title cleanliness**  
- Optional **.wav conversion via ffmpeg**  
- Logging and saving results to CSV for reproducibility

## 📄 Paper Study (Team) — *Arm Wave Quality Assessment*  
Discussed potential **approaches and novelty directions** for an upcoming paper on evaluating the quality of arm wave movements.  
Main points included:  
- How to collect and preprocess pose-based data for reliable evaluation  
- What baseline models to use for initial validation  
- Possible strategies for defining *quality metrics* and adapting them with learning frameworks  
- Considering a hybrid pipeline that balances classification and scoring aspects  

The goal is to establish a clear research direction where the novelty can be well justified, while keeping the implementation both feasible and meaningful.
