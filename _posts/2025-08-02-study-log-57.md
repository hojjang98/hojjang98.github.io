## 🧪 Competition — *Electricity Usage Forecasting* (DACON)

Three new experiments focused on segmentation and weighted ensemble tuning.

### 19. Model Per Building Type
Trained separate models for each building type to better reflect distinct patterns.

| Building Type     | Validation SMAPE |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Hotel             | 15.1100          |
| Commercial        | 5.3154           |
| Hospital          | 7.5401           |
| School            | 9.7351           |
| Others            | 21.6569          |
| Apartment         | 29.2067          |
| Research Lab      | 12.0202          |
| Department Store  | 14.3794          |
| IDC (Telco)       | 3.7473           |
| Public            | 10.9071          |

→ Public LB: **76.7876** (aggregated submission)

### 20. Weighted Voting Regressor (Optuna-Tuned)

Applied manual weights `(XGB: 0.5, LGBM: 0.3, GBR: 0.2)` after tuning each model individually with Optuna.

- Local: **15.5039**  
- Public LB: **12.4674**

---

### 21. Time-Split Voting Models

Segmented data by time of day:  
- Night: 0–8h  
- Day: 9–18h  
- Evening: 19–23h  

Trained separate VotingRegressor for each to reflect different load patterns.

- Local: **13.4856**  
- Public LB: **11.2358** ✅ *Best so far*

## 📝 SQL Study

Focused on **TCL (Transaction Control Language)** and **DCL (Data Control Language)**:  
- COMMIT / ROLLBACK / SAVEPOINT  
- GRANT / REVOKE

## 💡 Project Idea — *AI Pottery Assistant*

Proposed a creative concept: an intelligent assistant that analyzes pottery shapes, designs, and user prompts to assist in creative ceramic design.

## 📄 Paper Review — *Explainable Skeletal Assessment for Martial Arts*

✅ Finished **Day 4**: Experiments, Results, and SHAP-based interpretation.

### Key Takeaways:
- Strong performance on XSQ and PBB datasets (even outperforming experts in MAE)
- SHAP visualizations provide local/global feedback for motion quality
- Ablation shows alignment improves performance across models
- Final reflection: effective, interpretable motion scoring pipeline

## 🧪 Personal Project — *bass_seeker*

Moved away from Spotify API and focused on **audio-feature-based recommendation** using `.wav` data.  
Tested extraction pipeline using `librosa` and spectral centroid/bandwidth.  
📍 Project: [bass_seeker](https://github.com/hojjang98/ML-Projects/tree/main/bass_seeker)

## 🤝 Research Club — *Taekwondo Poomsae Evaluation*

Set new direction: **RLHF-based quantitative evaluation of Taekwondo forms**.

### Highlights:
- Pose-based + Similarity + Human Feedback (RLHF)
- Goal: Not just *what* the score is — but *why* it was given
- Core tech: DTW alignment, SHAP feedback, reinforcement learning
