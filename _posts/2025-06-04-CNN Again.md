# 🧠 [2025-06-04] MobileNetV2 Transfer Learning + Theory Review

Today was a combination of **experimenting with MobileNetV2** and **reviewing CNN-related concepts**.  
I resumed training on the real-time activity recognizer project using RGB input and pretrained weights, while brushing up on some Keras API logic and CNN structures.

---

## 📚 1. What I Studied

I revisited core training logic and neural network components to better understand model behavior and callbacks.

### ✅ Topics Reviewed
- `model.fit(...)` arguments and how `steps_per_epoch` works  
- Callback functions like `ModelCheckpoint`, `ReduceLROnPlateau`, `EarlyStopping`  
- Simple Dense model definition using `Sequential()`  
- Covariate shift: difference between training/test input distribution and its impact on generalization  
  → Explored strategies like data diversity & domain adaptation

## 🔁 2. Real-Time Activity Recognizer — Experiment_C

After previous grayscale trials failed to improve performance, I returned to RGB format and ran a MobileNetV2-based experiment with pretrained ImageNet weights.

### 🧪 Experiment C – MobileNetV2 RGB Baseline

- **Backbone**: MobileNetV2 (frozen base)  
- **Input**: RGB, 128x128, preprocessed with `mobilenet_v2.preprocess_input`  
- **Top Layers**:  
  - `GlobalAveragePooling2D()`  
  - `Dense(8, activation='softmax')`  
- **Optimizer**: Adam(learning_rate=0.0001)  
- **Callbacks**:  
  - `ModelCheckpoint`  
  - `ReduceLROnPlateau`  
  - `EarlyStopping`  
- **Training**: 125 epochs, batch size = 128  
- **Result**:  
  - Accuracy and loss improved steadily  
  - RGB clearly outperformed grayscale  
  - Graphs auto-saved to:

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

- MobileNetV2 shows stable performance even with minimal tuning  
- Grayscale input brought no benefits in this case  
- Revisiting foundational concepts helped clarify model behaviors and training structure

## 🎯 Next Steps

- ⏫ Try deeper models or increase filter sizes  
- 🔁 Experiment with different batch/image sizes  
- 🧪 Explore EfficientNetB0, ResNet variants  
- 📊 Compare this result with older grayscale & custom CNN baselines

Not a breakthrough day — but a stable, meaningful iteration.  
The real-time recognizer pipeline is shaping up well.
