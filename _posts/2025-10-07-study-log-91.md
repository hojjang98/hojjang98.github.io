## 📄 Coursework / Activities  
- **Deep Learning**  
  - Transitioned from manually built binary classifiers to model design using deep learning libraries.  

- **Blockchain & Cryptocurrency**  
  - Explored evolution from **Proof-of-Work** to **private and hybrid coins**, deepening understanding of modern crypto mechanisms.  

- **Big Data Analysis Practice**  
  - Studied statistical fundamentals critical for data analysis, including **chi-square** and **Poisson distributions**.  

- **Understanding Cryptography**  
  - Compared **classical** vs. **modern encryption**, identifying principles behind current cryptographic standards.  

- **Positive Psychology**  
  - Learned how **ownership vs. experience** affects happiness and practiced techniques like **mindfulness, walking meditation, and small joys**.  

- **AI-based Havruta Education**  
  - Examined five major **Havruta (dialogue-based learning)** models and their educational applications.  

- **AI Creative Convergence Strategy**  
  - Studied **generative AI** and its role in emerging creative industries and digital content creation.

## 📖 Paper Study – InternVideo2 (CVPR 2024)  
- Reviewed **InternVideo2: Scaling Video Foundation Models for Multimodal Understanding**.  
- Key insights:  
  - Introduces a **unified framework** combining masked video modeling, contrastive learning, and next-token prediction.  
  - Focuses on **spatiotemporal coherence** and **cross-modal (video–text–audio–speech)** alignment.  
  - Trained on **400M video-text pairs**, achieving SOTA in video retrieval, captioning, and action recognition.  
- Takeaway: InternVideo2 demonstrates how **scalable multimodal architectures** can generalize across diverse video-language tasks.
