# 👋 Hi, I'm Hojun!

I'm currently studying data science with a focus on machine learning and computer vision.  
I enjoy visual projects, building pipelines, and understanding what makes models tick.

This blog is where I share:
- 📚 My paper reviews (CV, ML)
- 🧪 Project logs & experiments
- ✍️ Daily study logs & observations

Feel free to connect or check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/hojjang98).
