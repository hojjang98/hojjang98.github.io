## 🎯 Current Focus

- Studying:
  - *Hands-On Machine Learning*, *Python for Data Analysis*, *Statistics for Data Science*
  - Computer Vision fundamentals and applications (Image Classification, Segmentation, Real-time Recognition)
  - Kaggle competitions and structured ML workflows (EDA → Modeling → Tuning → Deployment)
- Running solo projects (e.g., campaign prediction, energy forecasting, real-time CV recognizer)
- Tracking learning progress via GitHub and this blog
- Preparing for graduate school (target: 2026)
