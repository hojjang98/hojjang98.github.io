# 👋 Hi, I'm Hojun Choi!

I'm a self-driven data science learner on a mission to build solid, practical skills through hands-on projects and continuous learning.  
My journey started after discovering the power of machine learning during an AI competition. Since then, I've been steadily shaping my path toward becoming a **data scientist who can think critically, work ethically, and build meaningful models.**

## 🎯 What I’m currently focused on

- Studying: `Hands-On Machine Learning`, `Python for Data Analysis`, and `Statistics for Data Science`
- Running solo projects (e.g., traffic data analysis, XRP prediction attempts)
- Documenting my progress via GitHub and blog posts
- Preparing for graduate school (target: 2026 entry)

---

## 🧠 Interests

- **Machine Learning** (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, Optuna)
- **Statistical Modeling**
- **Healthcare Data** (particularly chronic disease prediction and monitoring)
- **Model interpretability**, real-world deployment, and error analysis

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Stack

- Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook, Git/GitHub
- ML frameworks: LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost

## 🎯 Career Goal

To become a data scientist capable of driving insights from messy, real-world data and solving practical problems — especially in healthcare.  
My long-term goal is to balance research and industry work to contribute to human well-being using data.
